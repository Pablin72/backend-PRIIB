API SAYS US CRUDE OIL OUPUT OFF FROM YEAR AGO
  The American Petroleum Institute
  said that US crude oil production in February declined 98
  pct from yearago levels to about 83 mln barrels a day
      In its monthly report on US oil supplies and stocks API
  said that domestic demand for petroleum products as measured
  by products supplied continued to rise reaching 163 mln
  barrels a day in the month up 15 pct from February 1986
      API noted the drop in crude oil output coupled with a
  drop in natural gas liquids production which was off 11 pct
  from February 1986 levels represented a decline in US
  production of more than one mln barrels a day
      API said the decline in domestic production and the rise in
  demand brought petroleum imports to about six mln barrels a day
  in February a 303 pct increase from last years level
      So far this year API said growth in domestic demand which
  was up 29 pct from last years yeartodate level has slowed
  in comparison to the accelerated growth in the last half of
  1986
      It said crude oil production for the first two months of
  1987 was off 86 pct from the comparable yearago period while
  crude imports were up 306 pct
