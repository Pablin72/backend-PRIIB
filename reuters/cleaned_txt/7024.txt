  take a 10 pct stake in ltShearson Lehman Brothers an
  investment banking unit of American Express Co ltAXP
      He said the firm started to sound out several US
  Investment banks on capital participation about 18 months ago
  and was narrowing the number of prospects but he did not say
  if it had set its sights on one firm
      Nippon Life Japans largest life insurer also plans to
  set up a wholly owned investment unit ltNissei International
  America in New York next month and subsidiaries in Canada
  Singapore the Cayman Islands and Jersey this year he said

  are growing

  of US Money and credit markets and wants to establish a firm
  foothold there the spokesman added
