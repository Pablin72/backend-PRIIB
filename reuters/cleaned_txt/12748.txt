TAIWAN ISSUES MORE CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT
  The Central Bank issued 565 billion dlrs
  worth of certificates of deposit CDs boosting CD issues so
  far this year to 14758 billion a bank spokesman told Reuters
      The new CDs with maturities of six months one year and
  two years carry interest rates ranging from 407 pct to 512
  pct he said
      The issues are intended to help curb the growth of the M1b
  money supply which has grown as a result of increasing foreign
  exchange reserves
      The reserves hit a record 53 billion US Dlrs last month
