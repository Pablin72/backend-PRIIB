BPltBP OFFER RAISES EXPECTATIONS FOR OIL VALUES
  British Petroleum Plcs plan to pay
  74 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has
  signalled higher values in the US oil patch analysts said
      I think that BPs bid is a very strong affirmation and
  clear signal that they have confidence in the US and they
  think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher
  said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc
      BP earlier today said its US unit planned to tender at 70
  dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already
  own
      Its a 74 billion dlr price that shows OPEC has won the
  war and oil prices are not going to crack said Prescott Ball
  and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier
      Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the
  energy issues out there in the stock market particularly those
  that are acquisition targets Lazier said
      One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp an
  energysteel concern which had been courted by investor Carl
  Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a
  Court last year Rumors continue to swirl around its stock
      Margoshes said he does not foresee major US oil firms
  falling into takeover situations for several years with the
  exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp ltAHC He said most of
  the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking
  which ended two years ago and others restructured to the point
  that they have become unattractive
      US oil stocks rallied in response to the offer Exxon
  Corp ltXON rose 118 to 8812 Chevron Corp ltCHV jumped
  118 to 5878 and Texaco ltTX climbed 14 to 3734 Unocal
  Corp ltUCL rose 134 while Occidental Petroleum Corp ltOXY
  climbed 118 to 3434 Amoco Corp ltAN rose 138 to 8334
      Standard Oils stock was up 614 in heavy trading to
  7118 Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 7214
  Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its
  offer by several dlrs per share but the company maintained it
  would not raise the 70 dlr bid
      British Petroleum stock rose 214 to 5958
      Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in
  the first place indicates that the British oil giant has
  changed its outlook for the oil industry
      Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the
  more bearish positions on oil prices
      They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs a
  barrel for several years and I think they beat a hasty
  retreat from that point of view Margoshes said
      They are more appropriately today looking more
  optimistically I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs
  longtermalso in their heart of hearts they believe that
  will be exceeded Margoshes said
      The US benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was
  trading today around 1860 dlrs per barrel
      Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy
  up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when
  oil prices were falling last year
      They said Standard Oils brightest asset is its slightly
  more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil
  field Analysts also said the company has other interests in
  the Alaskan North Slope
      Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely
  attractive to BP because the US is the largest oil market and
  has hardtoreplace reserves
      I think it just fits in with their longrange plans to
  increase their position in the US market Dean Witter
  analyst Eugene Nowak said
      Analysts said it also raises BPs visibility ahead of the
  British governments announced disposal of 317 pct of BP
  stock The UK government said it would dispose of the holding
  sometime in the year beginning April one
      After acquiring all of Standard most of BPs reserves
  would be in the US but only about six pct of its stock is
  held in the US
      The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it
  into the United States No other market can handle all that
  stock said LF rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua
      In 1986 Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs on
  revenues of 1002 billion dlrs compared to a profit the year
  earlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 1382 billion dlrs
