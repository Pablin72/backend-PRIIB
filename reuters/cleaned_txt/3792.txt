LICHT SEES STAGNANT EUROPEAN BEET AREA
  The overall area devoted to sugar
  beet in Europe is forecast to remain stagnant this year at 722
  mln hectares compared with 721 mln ha in 1986 West German
  statistician FO Licht said
      It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar prices
  would have a marked effect on planting intentions this year
  Licht said but judging by this first estimate the effect was
  probably minimal
      The total beet area in the European Community is forecast
  to fall two pct to 185 mln ha against 189 mln in 1986
      The total Western Europe area is put at 249 mln ha
  against 250 mln in 1986 Eastern Europe area is forecast at
  473 mln ha against 472 mln
      Individual West Europe country estimates in 1000 hectares
  with 1986 figures in brackets are BelgiumLuxembourg 114
  118 Denmark 69 69 France 419 421 Greece 35 44
  Ireland 36 38 Italy 270 275 Netherlands 129 138
  Portugal 1 1 Spain 192 190 UK 200 201 West Germany
  385 399 Austria 32 28 Finland 30 31 Sweden 51 52
  Switzerland 15 14 Turkey 355 340 Yugoslavia 160 136
      Eastern Europe plantings are forecast as follows USSR 3400
  3440 Albania 10 9 Bulgaria 52 50 Czechoslovakia 195
  196 East Germany 210 205 Hungary 108 96 Poland 460
  440 Romania 295 280
      On the basis of average yields this year Licht said these
  area forecasts pointed to a total European beet sugar crop in
  198788 of 298 mln tonnes raw value down from 314 mln
  tonnes in 198687 Licht said sugar yields were fairly high
  last season thanks to favourable weather and this increases
  the chances of a significant reduction in production in
  198788
      Based on average yields EC beet sugar production could
  fall nearly 10 pct this year to 135 mln tonnes from 149 mln
  in 198687 while total Western Europe production could be 169
  mln tonnes against 181 mln Eastern Europe production could be
  129 mln tonnes against 133 mln in 198687
