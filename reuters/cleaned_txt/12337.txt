FURTHER DECLINES IN US DEBT FUTURES POSSIBLE
  After an already steep fall in the past
  week US interest rate futures may be in for further declines
  in the near term financial analysts said
      However some analysts said recent sharp losses in bond
  futures have left the bond market somewhat oversold and the
  contracts on longterm debt could stage a recovery before
  resuming their decline
      Key to the nearterm direction of futures will be the
  course of the dollar they said
      As the dollar goes so goes the bond market said Dean
  Witter analyst Karen Gibbs
      The recent decline in the dollar which hit a 40year low
  against the Japanese yen Monday was reversed Wednesday when
  several large US money center banks unexpectedly raised their
  prime lending rates by a quarter point to 734 pct
      Even though the prime rate cut was good for the dollar
  foreign exchange traders are not convinced the dollar decline
  is over Gibbs said
      The dollar decline was key in recent weakness in debt
  futures as it rekindled concern about a pickup in inflation
      Indeed the falling dollar may have been a key topic at the
  meeting of the Federal Reserves policy making arm the Federal
  Open Market Committee this week analysts said
      To the Fed the combination of a falling dollar a
  steepening yield curve and rising commodity prices look
  suspiciously like the traces of expectations of accelerating
  inflation said Denis Karnosky analyst at Carroll McEntee
  and McGinley Inc
      Such expectations could mean that a shift in policy toward
  restriction of bank reserves is likely to get very serious
  consideration at the FOMC meeting he said
      Any such restriction of reserves will not be a highly
  visible form of monetary tightening Karnosky said
      Rather the key to detecting a change will be found in
  seasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window he
  said Borrowings have held near a weekly average of 300 mln
  dlrs over the past several months he said
      In the meantime however the market looks a bit
  oversold said Jim Wysoglad analyst at Golden Gate Futures
      Wysoglad said a recovery from the oversold condition could
  drive June bonds to a high near 99 before falling back to test
  chart support near the recent low of 971332
      Technician Leslie Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston
  said that the key test for June bonds will be whether the
  nearby contract holds above chart support at 962432
      All previous selloffs since midNovember have stopped and
  buyers have surfaced at that level Keefe said
      If that level is broken and the dollar continues to
  decline Keefe said she expects the June bond contract to
  decline to test support between 92 and 93 the primary uptrend
  line dating back to 1984
