AUSTRALIAN OIL INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE TAX CAMPAIGN
  The council of the
  Australian Petroleum Exploration Association APEA said it
  will press on with its campaign for major improvements to
  Australias petroleum taxation structure
      The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly
  disappointed by the Australian governments position on
  taxation as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy
  Minister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference
      As earlier reported Evans said he was inclined to target
  any tax changes rather than take a broadbased approach to
  secondary taxation of petroleum
      APEA had expected the government to make positive responses
  to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of
  existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and
  development the council said
      It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by
  Evans but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed
  with the current resource rental tax RRT legislation
      Evans told the conference the government did not plan to
  accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow
  deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure
      The governments unwillingness to allow the deduction of
  unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore
  area in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is
  profit based the APEA council said
      The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil
  exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the
  industrys concerns despite its recognition of the industrys
  problems the council said
      The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory
  secondary taxation of petroleum citing them as major
  disincentives at a time of low oil prices
