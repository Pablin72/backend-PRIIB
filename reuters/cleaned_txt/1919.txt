  ltHKBHHK is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and
  13 pct for 1986 reflecting stronger than expected loan growth

  12 pct
      They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 137 dlrs
  for a total of 175 dlrs for the year against 160 in 1985
      Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner
  reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise
  Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the
  Hong Kong economy in 1986 when gross domestic product grew by
  nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 45 pct
      They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand
  as their loan portfolio is well balanced an analyst at Mansion
  House Securities FE Ltd said
      Government figures show that total loans and advances rose
  by 138 pct in 1986 compared with a 45 pct increase in 1985
      Loans to finance Hong Kongs visible trade the mainstay of
  the local economy rose by 151 pct against a decline of five
  pct in 1985
      Low interest rates also helped the bank Interest received
  on loans was low with the prime rate at 65 pct at end1986
  but interest paid on savings was two pct Hongkong Bank and
  Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking
  system giving them access to a large base of lowcost funds
      The strength of the realestate market was another major
  income source for the bank group Loans to finance property
  development and instalment mortgages rose sharply
      The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage
  business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group
  and other foreign banks one analyst said
      The high level of activity on the capital and equities
  markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong

  Co analysts said Wardley had a tremendous year acting as
  financial adviser and underwriter an analyst said

  Bank owned 30 pct at the time

  for 157 billion dlrs It also sold its entire 488 pct stake
  in ltSouth China Morning Post Ltd the larger of two
  Englishlanguage daily newspapers here for 118 billion dlrs
      The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will
  not show up in the profit and loss accounts analysts said
      Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced
  need to write off bad debts The need for provisions was much
  lower than the year before said Tony Measor of Hong Leong
  Securities Co Ltd Last years profits should have been 28 to
  29 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions
      Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the
  bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its
  shipping exposure in 1985 Lesley Nickolds of County Securities
  Asia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986 She
  forecast profit of 299 billion dlrs
