TALKS SHOW NEW CANADIAN CONFIDENCE GROUP SAYS
  Canadas decision to raise the issue
  of a free trade pact with the US was a sign of what many see
  as a new spirit of Canadian selfconfidence a public policy
  study group said 
      It suggests the Canada of the immediate postwar period
  when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar
  world the Washingtonbased Atlantic Council said
      US and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summer
  aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries
  the worlds biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments
  of about 150 billion dlrs annually
      The councils study said the trade talks with a deadline
  of October for an agreement are the biggest issue in
  USCanadian relations
     The study said liberalized trade between the two countries
  would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world
  markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties
      The council said in the past most Canadians have shied away
  from the notion of a freetrade arrangement fearing to be
  overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer
  association with a country 10 times their size in population
      But at the same time it added Canadians realized their
  domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and
  sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an
  increasingly competitive world
      The council said that in the talks Canada is chiefly
  interested in minimizing the imposing of US duties against 
  allegedly subsidized exports
      A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the US imposed
  on Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being
  subsidized
      The council said the chief US concerns included ending
  curbs against US banking insurance telecommunications and
  the socalled cultural industries  publishing broadcasting
  and films
      It said other major USCanadian issues were defense
  cooperation acid rain and the US rejection of a Canadian
  assertion of sovereignty over waters of the Northwest Passage
