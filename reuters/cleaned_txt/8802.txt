FED MAY ADD RESERVES ECONOMISTS SAY
  The Federal Reserve may intervene in
  the government securities market to add reserves today some
  economists said although others felt that the Fed was likely
  to refrain from any action
      Those who believed the Fed will intervene said it would
  probably add temporary reserves indirectly via 15 to two
  billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements
      But others noted the Feds current addneed is not large
  They also expected the federal funds rate to edge lower
      Fed funds which averaged 621 pct on Monday opened at
  618 pct and remained at that level in early trading
