PHARMACIA FORECASTS HIGHER 1987 EARNINGS
  Pharmacia AB ltPHAB ST forecast
  earnings after financial items of one billion crowns in 1987 vs
  8212 mln last year on condition that exchange rates remained
  at their present parities
      Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion
  crowns from 365 billion in 1986 it said
      A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct
  negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed
  on currency movements
      Last years results were also badly hit by a onceoff
  writedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets
      The company said mainly this represented the premium the
  group had paid for the knowhow of various hightech firms it
  had taken over
      The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 187
  billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly
  by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and
  partly by increasing borrowing to 223 billion vs 621 mln
      Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it
  having used more funds than generated by group operations
  mainly because of the 136 billion it paid in cash for shares
  in LKBProdukter AB and the assets of IntermedicsIntraocular
  Inc
