JAGUAR SEES STRONG GROWTH IN NEW MODEL SALES
  Jaguar Plc ltJAGRL is about to sell its
  new XJ6 model on the US And Japanese markets and expects a
  strong reception based on its success in the UK Chairman Sir
  John Egan told a news conference
      Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to
  8304 mln stg and pretax profits at 1208 mln stg slightly
  below 1985s 1213 mln Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average
  profit growth of 15 pct per year However the introduction of
  the new model had kept this years pretax profit down
      Jaguar starts selling XJ6 in the US In May and plans to
  sell 25000 of its total 47000 production there in 1987
      US Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover
  finance director John Edwards said
      A US Price for the car has not been set yet but Edwards
  said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German
  competitors offered an umbrella for Jaguar He added the XJ6
  had also to compete with US Luxury car producers which would
  restrict the cars price
      Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a
  12month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of
  its receipts for longer periods John Egan said
      In the longer term capital expenditure will amount to 10
  pct of net sales Research and development will cost four pct
  of net sales and training two pct
      Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the
  other half The firm is in early stages of considering the
  building of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg
  but Egan said this would take at least another three years
      On the London Stock Exchange Jaguars shares were last
  quoted at 591p down from 611p at yesterdays close after
  reporting 1986 results which were in line with market
  expectations dealers said
