UK MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 800 MLN STG
  The Bank of England said it forecast a
  shortage of around 800 mln stg in the money market today
      Among the main factors affecting liquidity bills maturing
  in official hands and the takeup of treasury bills will drain
  around 118 billion stg while bankers balances below target
  will take out some 20 mln stg
      Partly offseting these outflows a fall in note circulation
  and exchequer transactions will add some 355 and 55 mln stg to
  the system respectively
