WALL STREET STOCKSMARION LABS ltMKC
  Marion Laboratories Incs stock rose
  sharply today after the company presented a bullish earnings
  scenario at a meeting for pharmaceutical analysts Monday
  traders and analysts said
      The company said it expects earnings for fiscal 1987
  ending June 30 to rise more than 75 pct over a year ago
      That pronouncement encouraged analyst David Crossen of
  Sanford C Bernstein and Co to raise his earnings estimates for
  the company to 128 dlrs a share in 1987 compared to his
  previous estimate of 120 dlrs a share Last year the company
  earned 70 cts a share
      Marions stock gained 314 to 7512
      At the meeting of pharmaceutical analysts Marions
  president Fred Lyons Jr said Wall Street eanrings estimates of
  110115 dlrs a share for fiscal 1987 are expected to cause
  even the aggressive side of this range to be 10 to 15 cts low
      Lyons said the strong performance in the second half of
  this year will result from the fourth quarter introduction of
  90 mg and 120 mg Cardizem tablets Analyst Crossen said that
  Cardizem which treats angina is also expected to be approved
  for the treatment of hypertension by the end of the year
      Crossen said because Marion is still just a small company
  the growth of Cardizem is having a big impact on the bottom
  line He raised fiscal 1988 earnings estimates to 215 dlrs a
  share from his previous estimate of 205 dlrs a share
      The company has a broad new product pipeline in the
  industry and as far as I am concerned it is the most
  innovative company in the business he said
      For the five years through 1991 Crossen expects Marion to
  have a growth rate of 55 pct
