AFTER G6 ROUND ONE GOES TO CENTRAL BANKS
  Central banks have easily beaten back
  the foreign exchange markets first test of the industrialized
  nations recent pact to stabilize currencies analysts said
      In active trading this week the market pushed the dollar
  sterling the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar higher But
  operators got their fingers burned as one by one the central
  banks signalled their displeasure
      So far G6 has been a roaring successsaid James ONeill
  financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA
      The central banks are sending strong signals that they
  wont tolerate any kind of momentum building behind
  currencies added a senior corporate trader at one UK bank
      On February 22 the finance ministers and central bank
  governors of the US Japan West Germany France and the UK
   the Group of Five  plus Canada signed an accord under
  which they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of
  exchange rates around prevailing levels
      The agreement was viewed by many in the market as an
  attempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable
  twoyear decline against major world currencies
      And initially traders indicated their respect for the
  accord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower
      But by Wednesday the dollar climbed to more than 187
  marks about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday before
  the G6 accord
      The move was aided by indications that the US economy
  picked up steam in February at the same time as the West German
  economy was regressing
      But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gave
  traders a sharp reminder that the G6 pact had encompassed the
  idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines
      Dealers differed as to whether the US central bank
  actually intervened to sell dollars above 187 marks or simply
  telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading
  conditions
      But the dollar quickly backed off It hovered today around
  185 marks The market was surprised that the Fed showed its
  face so soon said Marine Midland NAs ONeill
      Also on Wednesday London dealers said the Bank of England
  intervened in the open market to sell sterling as the UK
  currency rose to 160 dlrs compared with 15355 dlrs before the
  G6 pact
      Sterling along with the other highyield currencies like
  the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar was in favor after
  traders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant
  to the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays
  on dollarmark and dollaryen
      The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving
  UK economy anticipation of a popular British budget on March
  17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for the
  incumbent Conservative party in any general election
      There was a real run on sterling said Anne Mills of
  Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc
      Sterling traded today around 15750 dlrs down from 15870
  dlrs last night It slid to 2917 marks from 2950 yesterday
  and from a peak of about 298 recently Theres been some
  heavy profittaking on sterlingmark ahead of next Tuesdays
  UK budget said James McGroarty of Discount Corp
      As speculators detected the presence of the US and
  British central banks they acclerated their shift into
  Canadian and Australian dollars But here too they were
  stymied The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currencys rise
      The Canadian dollar traded at 1321823 per US dollar
  today down from 1318590 yesterday
      And the Australian Reserve Bank using the Fed as agent
  sold Australian dollars in the US yesterday dealers said
      The Australian dollar fell to a low of 674555 US cents
  today from a high of 6902 Thursday
      Analysts said the central banks moves to stifle sudden
  upward movement leave the market uncertain about its next
  step Today the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a
  very tight range against the dollar for several months
      The dollar fell to 1523540 yen from 1533540 last night
  Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long
  sterlingshort mark positions established lately
      Because of the change in perceptions about the health of
  the German economy the funds from those unwinding operations
  are ending up in yen a dealer at one UK bank said
      Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders
  lower industrial output and slowing employment gains
      Moreover the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities who
  have invested heavily overseas for example in Australian
  financial instruments repatriate their profits ahead of the
  end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31
      Noting that the dollaryen rate is in a sense the most
  controversial one because of the large US trade deficit with
  Japan analysts said the stage could be set for another test of
  the dollars downward scope against the Japanese currency
      In its latest review of the foreign exchange market through
  the end of January the Federal Reserve revealed that it
  intervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January 28
  On that day the dollar fell as low as 15040 yen
      Sure the Fed bought dollars near the 150 yen level in
  January But the market has to bear in mind that time marches
  on and the situation changes said McGroarty of Discount
