EXXON ltXON GAINS DUE TO STREAMLINED OPERATIONS
  Exxon Corp said that 1986s 15 pct
  increase in earnings per share to 742 dlrs a share were
  partially based on its streamlined operations which compensated
  for the weakness in its exploration earnings and the lowest
  crude oil prices in a decade
      Exxon said economies introduced in its operations from
  reductions in personnel and other savings such as reductions
  in exploration expenses were reflected in an 880 mln dlr
  reduction in consolidated operating costs from 1985
      The company said its more efficient operations would be
  necessary to offset more adverse oil market conditions ahead
      The company also said that its share repurchase plan
  contributed to the per share gains over 1985
      In a breakdown of costs Exxon said that operating expenses
  slipped to 92 billion dlrs in 1986 from 97 billion dlrs the
  previous year and exploration expenses including dry holes
  slipped back to 12 billion dlrs from 15 billion dlrs over the
  same period as the number of wells drilled was lower
      The company was also able to use lower interest rates to
  reduce its interest expenses to 614 mln dlrs in 1986 from 627
  mln dlrs the previous year
      Exxon said that the ratio of debt to capital was cut by 16
  pct in 1986 from the previous year to 19 pct
      On December 31 1986 Exxons total debt of 787 billion
  dlrs was down slightly from the previous years 79 billion
  dlrs and long term debt stood at 43 billion dlrs down from
  48 billion dlrs in 1985
      Exxons policy of repurchasing shares on the market for its
  treasury also contributed to earnings results by a reduction of
  shares to 7226 mln shares from 7541 mln shares the previous
  year
