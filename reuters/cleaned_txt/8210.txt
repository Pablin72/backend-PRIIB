WORLD DEPENDENCY ON MIDEAST OIL SAID INEVITABLE
  The worlds dependency on the Mideast
  as the source for its petroleum is growing and nothing is going
  to stop it Donald K McIvor an Exxon Corp ltXON Director and
  senior vice president told Reuters in an interview
      NonOPEC production will begin to decline and the gap
  between demand and supply will widen so that the trend to
  increasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East is
  inevitable McIvor said
      Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but are
  not likely to change a growing dependence McIvor said
      McIvor Exxons senior vice president responsible for oil
  and gas exploration and production said that dependence would
  result from the Mideasts large spare capacity at a time when
  the rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding
      Since 1970 weve been consuming oil at rates of 2025
  billion barrels per year while making new discoveries of only
  about 1015 bilion barrels per year McIvor said
      The bulk of the inventory and more than half of the
  remaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which is
  producing at much less than current capacity he added
      McIvor said that of the some 30000 oil fields discovered
  so far only 37 oneone thousandth of the total number contained
  about 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered
      McIvor said in response to a question that he did not
  believe there were any more super giants or oil fields with
  reserves greater than five billion barrels to be found which
  would change the conclusion of the worlds growing dependency
      Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the Middle
  East Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20
  years and only two of these lie outside the middle east
  Cantarell in Mexico and Alaskas North Slope McIvor said
      McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the US
  like Alaskas Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching a
  peak and would soon begin to decline
      But the Exxon executive said that there were still plenty
  of opportunities to be explored and developed outside of the
  Middle east particulartly in Canada the North Sea and
  Australia and Africa
      McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in those
  areas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higher
  price of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the
  companies
      The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is a
  constant change in policies McIvor said
      McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to
  increase exploration as these only benefit one part of the
  economy at the expense of other parts of the economy
      Asked about the options offered this week by US Energy
  Secretary Herrington to increase US production McIvor said he
  could not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowance
  now but the thrust of his Herrington report is valid It has
  highlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and the
  need to increase US production
      McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play a
  greater role in the future in meeting energy needs
      Natural gas will have the opportunity to become an
  increasingly important part of the worlkds energy supply
  McIvor said
      Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportation
  fuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat as an
  industrial fuel he added
