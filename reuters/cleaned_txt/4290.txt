US RETAIL SALES RISE MASKS WEAK TREND  ANALYSTS
  US retail sales rose sharply in
  February but many economists said the underlying consumer
  spending trend remains weak
      February retail sales jumped 41 pct more than the 2530
  pct rise the financial markets had anticipated But Januarys
  sales were revised down to a 74 pct drop from a previously
  reported 58 pct decline
      The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at a
  much more sluggish pace said Don Maude of Midland Montagu
  Capital Markets Inc
      Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data
  over past four months to show that the pace of consumer
  spending is slowing
      Combining the latest data with a 06 pct drop in November
  and a 46 pct gain in December the average retail sales gain
  over the four months was 02 pct he said compared to to a 04
  pct rise for yearoveryear sales through February
      You can see a pattern developing Maude said I wouldnt
  be surprised to see a falloff in March especially since sales
  probably wont be boosted by auto sales as they were in
  February
      Despite the weak underlying trend economists were
  impressed by a robust 15 pct gain in total sales excluding
  autos in February This compared to a revised 04 pct decline
  in January previously reported as a 01 pct decline
      The increase in nonauto sales was broadbased with gains
  in durable goods as well as nondurables noted Ward McCarthy
  of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc It was a pretty healthy
  report
      He noted that building materials rose 18 pct in February
  after falling 17 pct in January General merchandise store
  sales gained 14 pct after a 16 pct rise in January
      There are signs of life in the economy McCarthy said
  But its jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this report
  into the future 
      A 07 pct increase in disposable personal income in January
  which may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boost
  spending in February he said
      A lot of people may be inadvertently underwithholding
  taxes from their paychecks he said When people in this
  country get an increase in disposable income the inclination
  is to go out and spend it he said
      Economists said tomorrows release of US auto sales for
  the first 10 days of March will be an important indicator of
  how much this sector will add to first quarter spending
       Auto sales accounted for the lions share of total
  February sales rising 144 pct This followed a 277 pct drop
  in January previously reported as a 224 pct fall due largely
  to the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws
  January 1 the Commerce Department noted
      Some economists argued that the because the gain in total
  sales excluding autos also followed a decline in January the
  strength in the February report is less than impressive
      There is strength in the February data but thats because
  they were compared to low sales levels in January said said
  Beth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc We dont see it as a
  precursor of continued strength
      Durable goods sales rose 88 pct in February after falling
  177 pct in January February nondurable goods sales gained
  13 pct after declining 02 pct in January
      Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February
  following a 19 pct gain in January but economists said higher
  oil prices rather than an increased volume of gas sales
  probably accounted for these gains
      Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spending
  is weakening Total retail sales on average were 123 billion
  dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986 she said In January they
  fell to a seasonally adjusted 11752 bilion dlrs and in
  February rose to 12229 billion dlrs
      On average it looks like theyll total 120 to 121 mln
  dlrs in the first quartrer she said We dont look at this
  as indication that the economy is barrelling along
      The number is not really that problematic for those of us
  who are constructive on the bond market agreed Elliot Platt
  of Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp
      Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetary
  policy on the basis of the latest retail sales report
      The Fed is on hold now because the data have been so
  confusing he said
      Before the 337000 gain in February nonfarm payroll
  employment I would have looked for a discount rate cut in
  March he said But now Fed officials will have to wait for
  the first quarter real US gross national product data in
  April to sort things out
