AUSTRALIAN OIL TAX CUT SEEN BOOSTING OUTPUT
  A 10 percentage
  point reduction in the Australian governments maximum crude
  oil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output
  resources analyst Ian Story said here
      A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Strait
  output to be maintained at the current rate of 420000 barrels
  per day BPD for the next year rather than falling to 380000
  BPD in 198788 he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration
  Association annual conference
      Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydney
  stockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd
      Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longer
  appropriate in the current economic climate Story said
      The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil  that discovered
  before September 1975  is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co
  Ltd ltBRKNSExxon Corp ltXON partnership to shutin
  production accelerating the decline in output and reducing
  government revenue he said
      He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30
  Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 207 dlrs from 080 dlrs
  if the levy was cut to 70 pct
      The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive
  at oil prices below 30 dlrs Story said
      Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher
  levels of selfsufficiency increase government revenue boost
  exports and provide incentives for exploration and development
  he said
      The government is currently reviewing the oil tax
  structure
