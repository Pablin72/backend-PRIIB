LOWER TAX OFFSETS LOWER SHELL UK UPSTREAM PROFIT
  ltShell UK Ltds pretax profit on
  exploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in
  1986 from 212 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil prices
  last year Shell UK Finance director Nigel Haslam said
      But he told a press conference that due to the high
  marginal tax rate on North Sea operations the main impact of
  the drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330
  mln stg from 145 billion in 1985
      The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax with
  Petroleum Revenue Tax PRT representing only 16 mln stg he
  said
      As a result posttax profit from the exploration and
  production sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln
      Earlier Shell UK a subsidiary of Royal DutchShell
  Group ltRDAS reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg
  up from 667 mln in 1985 on sales of 657 billion stg against
  881 mln
      Shell UK Chairman Bob Reid said the companys crude oil
  output from the North Sea was at a record 373000 bpd in 1986
  which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for the
  company Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in the
  current year to around 340000 bpd due mainly to the decline
  in output from the major Brent field he said
      Gas output of 59 billion cubic metres and natural gas
  liquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected to
  be maintained in 1987 he said
      A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and Osprey
  North Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months
  Reid said The Kittiwake field originally part of the 25
  billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oil
  price fell is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg
      Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider North
  Sea fields which were approved last year have brought the
  cost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget
      Day to day operating costs of the exploration and
  production sector had been cut 10 pct last year and the target
  is to keep costs per barrel constant
      The company drilled 17 wells offshore with 10 leading to
  the discovery of hydrocarbons although it is too early to
  gauge the commercial viability of these discoveries Reid said
      Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to a
  profit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985
      Jaap Klootwijk managing director of downstream unit ltShell
  UK Oil said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987
  were a bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986
      In November and December in particular refining operations
  had shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil
  product prices he said He expected margins to continue
  generally positive over the summer although they could dip to
  become negative from time to time depending on price
  movements
      A new catalytic cracker at Shells Stanlow refinery will
  now come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988 about five
  months behind schedule following a crane accident which
  severely damaged the plant last year he said
      Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from
  11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemical
  site
      Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief by which
  companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying
  development expenditure on certain future oil fields against
  PRT was helpful but rather less than had been hoped for
      Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was in
  the range of 15 to 18 dlrs If prices went much above that he
  would expect some overproduction above OPECs official 158 mln
  bpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down
      He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrain
  output was holding bringing supply and demand into balance
  but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil will
  fall
