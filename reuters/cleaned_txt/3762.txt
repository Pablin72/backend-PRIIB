NATIONAL SAVINGS MOVE POINTS TO LOWER UK RATES
  UK Interest rates look set to move
  lower even after Mondays halfpoint cut in bank base rates to
  1012 pct analysts said citing as evidence the suspension of
  a British National Savings issue yesterday
      The Department of National Savings effectively a Treasury
  Department unit yesterday suspended its 32nd issue launched
  in October and paying a high taxfree 834 pct on fiveyear
  private investments between 25 and 5000 stg A spokesman said
  the suspension was just a reaction to yields on national
  savings bonds being way out of line with the rest of the
  market
      The move was followed by a surprise sellout within minutes
  today of a Bank of England onebillion stg tap issue the
  second such issue in as many weeks analysts noted
      They said the nearinstant sale of the entire new gilts
  issue for which the Bank of England had required a high 40 pct
  downpayment was clear evidence that the market thought rates
  had to drop sooner rather than later
      The sale of the tranche of 834 pct treasury bonds due
  1997 occurred in an active bullish gilts market as downward
  pressure on money market rates remained intact with the
  bellwether threemonth interbank rate down 18 point at
  10978 pct
       It coincided with another strong sterling rally which
  pushed the pound to fouryear highs against the dollar
      That government stock disappeared very quickly indeed said
  Stephen Lewis head of economic research at stockbrokers
  Phillips and Drew It is an indication that the market believes
  rates are going to fall further  At least by a halfpoint
  immediately after the budget on March 17 and some people
  hope for more
      Stockbrokers James Capel said in a comment the move by the
  National Savings Department was of considerable significance
      It said the real message  Is that the decks are being
  quickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by the
  building societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cut
  in bank base rates to 10 pct materialises
      Building societies have said a drop in bank base rates
  would normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to a
  reduction in mortgage lending rates
      Lewis of Phillips and Drew said he too believed the
  National Savings issue suspension may reflect new UK Treasury
  policy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut
      National Savings has been competing too effectively with
  the building societies of late Building society income has
  been depressed in recent months he said
      He and other analysts said Chancellor of the Exchequer
  Nigel Lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lid
  on UK Inflation
      Underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in Britain
  than in most other Western economies with inflation seen rising
  well above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 after
  last years 37 pct
      Emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumer
  prices Lewis said a onepoint cut in building society rates
  would reduce inflation in Britain by about 04 pct
      But Lewis and others noted that building societies had been
  complaining to the government about intense competition from
  National Savings which they argued reduced the scope for early
  mortgage rate cuts
      The Chancellor need not be worried about losing some PSBR
  funding from National Savings but he must be taking the
  building societies criticism to heart It looks like the
  National Savings move reflects this one senior dealer said
      A Savings Department spokesman refused to comment on this
  interpretation saying the suspension of the issue was merely a
  reaction to the recent fall in UK Interest rates which had
  pushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line with
  the rest of the market
      We are not politically motivated  Funding was just
  becoming too expensive and we dont need all that money he
  told Reuters adding the department had suspended issues at
  least twice in the past when offered interest rates were above
  or below market rates
      He said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late as
  UK Money market rates continued their steady decline and
  income was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billion
  stg target set for fiscal 1986 ending March 31
      In the first 10 months of fiscal 1986 National Savings
  contribution to government funding totalled 272 billion stg
  compared with 201 billion stg in the same period of the
  previous year official figures show
      Figures for February out on Monday are expected to show a
  further increase of between 300 and 400 mln stg pushing the
  total for 11 months above target government officials said
