AUSTRALIA SAID TO RELY TOO MUCH ON OIL TAXES
  The governments
  overreliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affecting
  Australias economic performance Australian Petroleum
  Exploration Association APEA chairman Dennis Benbow said
      Over onethird of Australias indirect tax income is
  derived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak
  crude prices he told the APEA annual conference here
      This dependence on oilgenerated revenue distorts the
  countrys economic performance directly by acting as a
  disincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting
  trading competitiveness through high energy costs he said
      Australias mediumterm liquid fuel selfsufficiency
  position is posing a major economic threat yet the
  governments response has been to load new tax burdens on the
  oil industry Benbow said
      Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to
  fall to 280000 barrels per day bpd in fiscal 199293 from
  546000 bpd in 198586 reflecting mainly the decline of the
  Bass Strait fields he said
      Bass Strait reserves are now twothirds depleted with the
  three largest fields 80 pct depleted he said
      By 199293 Bass Strait output is expected to be just over
  half the 198586 level assuming a number of so far undeveloped
  fields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from
  existing fields goes ahead Benbow said
      Government projections of output from as yet undiscovered
  fields range from 40000 to 130000 bpd he said
      Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to
  680000 bpd in 199293 from 565000 in 198586 implying a
  crude oil gap of between 270000 and 360000 bpd in five years
  time he said
      At present world oil prices and the current value of the
  Australian dollar annual oil imports in 199293 would cost
  between 32 billion and 36 billion dlrs Benbow said
      Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980s the
  addition to reserves has been inadequate he said
      For example the 409 mln barrels discovered in the five
  years 198084 represent about two years consumption he said
      He called on the government to review its tax policies to
  restore incentive to exploration
