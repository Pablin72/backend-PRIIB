WOODSIDE SAYS LOSS REFLECTS LOWER OIL PRICES
  Woodside Petroleum Ltd ltWPLAS said
  its 1986 net loss largely reflected the drop in oil prices
  combined with a large tax provision
      Woodside earlier reported attributable net loss rose to
  1714 mln dlrs in 1986 from 873 mln in 1985 although group
  revenue rose to 22084 mln from 17350 mln
      It said it should have received a 17 mln dlr tax credit
  but instead made a 1004 mln dlr tax provision This largely
  related to its ltVamgas Ltd unit nonallowable exchange losses
  and tax benefits from the NorthWest Shelf project not
  recognised in the accounts
      Woodside said the rise in revenue largely reflected full
  year sales of gas and condensate from the domestic phase of the
  Shelf project against six month sales in 1985
      Offsetting this was a 23 pct fall in the Cooper Basin gas
  and liquids revenue of its 506 pctowned Vamgas unit
      Since the balance date Woodside has accepted a Santos Ltd
  ltSTOSS takeover offer for Vamgas
      Woodside said a 928 mln dlr capital profit on the sale
  would be included in the 1987 accounts
      It said it lifted capital spending on fixed assets to 2696
  mln dlrs from 1783 mln mostly on the Shelf project
