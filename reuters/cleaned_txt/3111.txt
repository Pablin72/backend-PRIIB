UK ISSUES ONE BILLION STG BOND TRANCHE
  The Bank of England said it was taking
  onto its books a further one billion stg tranche of 834 pct
  Treasury Loan stock due 1997 payable 40 stg pct on
  application The stock was issued to the Bank at 9650 stg pct
  and will be available for dealings from March 11 with the
  remainder of the amount payable on May 5 The Bank said the
  bonds would yield 928 pct at the issue price and would be free
  of tax to residents overseas The issue would be designated
  834 pct Treasury Loan 1997 B  A further 100 mln stg was
  reserved for the National Debt Commissioners
      The market dropped by up to 12 point following the Banks
  announcement with the Treasury 1312 pct stock due 200408
  quoted one full point lower at 1341232 stg pct around 20
  minutes after the news
      Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the
  backdrop of intense pressure for lower UK Interest rates
  which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of
  sterlings strength
      The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to
  see lower rates and UK Clearing banks this afternoon
  announced cuts in their base lending rates to 105 pct from 11
  pct
      The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate
  cut because dealers said the authorities had wished to delay
  a reduction until around the time of the UK Budget on March
  17 thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the
  Exchequer Nigel Lawsons package of measures
      However in the face of sterlings apparently inexorable
  climb the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and
  allow a halfpoint cut
      Todays one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market
  as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early
  rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling
      Most market participants believe that Lawson will now
  foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time
  of the budget although one or two said they would not be
  surprised to see a full point decline at this stage
      Dealers noted that as part of the authorities attempts
  last week to ease pressure for lower rates the Bank had issued
  a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the
  Government bond market
      To the surprise of most participants the issue was sold
  out within hours of becoming available for trading and the
  market pushed on to register further sharp gains
      Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the
  issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as
  rapidly as last weeks
      However they noted that although sterling had edged down
  from its highs following the base rate cut it had still closed
  on a tradeweighted basis at 724 well ahead of Fridays final
  718 and only just beneath the peak of 725 touched at 1300
