JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS SEEK CARTEL TO RESTRICT OUTPUT
  Japanese shipbuilders have applied to the
  states Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to restrict
  tonnage built to about half of total capacity for the year
  starting April 1 officials of the Shipbuilders Association of
  Japan said
      Under the plan 33 yards capable of building ships of more
  than 10000 gross tons will curtail operations to three mln
  compensated gross registered tonnes CGRT a year against
  capacity of about six mln CGRT
      The Transport Ministry estimates new orders at 33 mln CGRT
  in the year to March 1988 and 31 mln the following year
      The industry has curtailed production due to oversupply
  nearly every year since 197778 under cartel or Transport
  Ministry guidelines The latest guidelines call for a ceiling
  of four mln CGRT in the year to March 31
      The cartels selfimposed and selfregulated are not
  legally binding but industry finds it in its own interest to
  stick to them
      The slowdown in orders has been caused by the strong yen
  and a protracted worldwide shipbuilding slump
