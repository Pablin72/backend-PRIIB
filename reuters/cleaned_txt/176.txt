LNG IMPORTS FROM ALGERIA UNLIKELY IN 1987
  Liquefied natural gas imports from
  Algeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its
  economically feasible US industry analysts sources said
      Youcef Yousfi directorgeneral of Sonatrach the Algerian
  state petroleum agency indicated in a television interview in
  Algiers that such imports would be made this year
      Contract negotiations filing with the US government and
  the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay
  the import until 19881989 Daniel Tulis a natural gas
  analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros said
      Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former
  customers Panhandle Eastern ltPEL and Distrigas a subsidiary
  of Cabot Corp ltCBT to resume LNG export company officials
  told Reuters A third El Paso Gas a subsidiary of Burlington
  Northern ltBNI has expressed no interest
      Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG were
  feasible On a marginal cost basis the companies that have
  made capital investment to handle LNG import can operate
  profitably even in the current price environment  Frank
  Spadine an energy economist with Bankers Trust said
     Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports
  on US prices which are currently soft but expected to trend
  higher by the end of 1987
      A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of
  Mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm
  prices Shearsons Tulis said
     In this context Algerian LNG import would be a source of
  supplemental supply to US domestic production he added
      Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree
  saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand
      Company sources also said that any negotiations with
  Algeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate
  volumes to market requirements and prices to US spot market
  values
