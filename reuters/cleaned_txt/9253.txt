OIL ANALYST SEES PAPUA NEW GUINEA AS GOOD PROSPECT
  Papua New Guinea
  PNG provides the most exciting new prospect in the
  AsiaPacific region for oil production energy analyst Fereidun
  Fesharaki said here
      The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNG
  on the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s he told
  the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual
  conference
      Fesharaki leader of the Energy Program at the EastWest
  Center in Honolulu Hawaii was speaking on the AsiaPacific
  petroleum outlook
      With domestic demand of around 12000 barrels per day bpd
  and prospects of production of over 100000 bpd by late 1991
  PNG would become an Ecuadorlevel crude exporter Fesharaki
  said
      The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the best
  oil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG
      The PNG governments Geological Survey in a paper
  distributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves at
  about 500 mln barrels
      PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region with
  no secondary taxes Fesharaki said
      We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea and
  discovery of much larger volumes of oil similar in quality to
  light Bass Strait crude Fesharaki said
      There are also large pockets of high quality condensates to
  be produced notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which is
  capable of producing 30000 to 40000 bpd he said
      But prices should be somewhat higher than the present
  levels to justify development of the Juha field he said
      The PNG Geological Survey paper noted there are five large
  prospective but littleexplored sedimentary basins in PNG
