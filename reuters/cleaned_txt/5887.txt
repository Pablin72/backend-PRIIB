SOUTH AMERICAN FISH MEAL PRODUCTION AT RECORD HIGH
  Production of fish meal by the three
  South American producers  Chile Peru and Equador  last
  year reached 25 mln tonnes equalling the record output of
  1970 the International Association of Fish Meal Manufacturers
  IAFMM said
      However IAFMM said in a statement that it expected Chilean
  and Peruvian fish meal production in the first quarter of 1987
  to be much lower than the 651000 tonnes produced in the last
  quarter of 1986 due to a ban on sardine fishing in Chile for
  the month of February and to adverse fishing conditions in Peru
  in the same month
      The statement added that due to technical market promotion
  and energetic sales by Chile and Peru the stock position at
  the end of the year remained reasonable
      Fish meal production outside South America decreased
  slightly falling from 114400 to 111100 tonnes
      The IAFMM said fish meal consumption in 1986 rose in West
  Germany Scandinavian countries Eastern Europe and the Far
  East but fell in the US And remained static in the UK
      It added that fish meal consumption had suffered from
  competition with feed grade tallow in the US And with skimmed
  milk powder in the UK
      IAFMM figures for fish oil production in the main producing
  nations in thousands of tonnes were
