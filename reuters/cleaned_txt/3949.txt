US CORN DEMAND GROWING IN JAPAN SOUTH KOREA

  tonnes of US corn by Japan and 600000 tonnes by South Korea
  suggests that the two countries demand for reliable supplies

  said that view is reinforced by the expectation of a decline in
  exportable supplies of Argentine corn and uncertainty over the
  availability of South African and Chinese corn

  mln tonnes of US corn in 198687 SeptAug nearly 400000
  tonnes greater than yearago figures to date
