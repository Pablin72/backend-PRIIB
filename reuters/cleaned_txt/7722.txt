MCDONALDS ltMCD UP ON REAFFIRMED RECOMMENDATION
  The stock of McDonalds Corp rose
  sharply this morning after analyst Daniel Lee of Drexel Burnham
  Lambert Inc reiterated his recommendation of the stock traders
  said
      McDonalds an operator of fast food restaurants rose
  158 to 7738
      Comparable store sales are up 56 pct in 1986 vs 1985
  Lee said and the stock is trading below the market multiple
  He said not many companies have a consistent 15 pct annual
  earnings growth rate return on equity above 20 pct but trade
  at less than the market multiple
      Analyst Lee said the introduction of a new line of salads
  this spring at about the time we are all trying to squeeze
  into bathing suits should boost sales
      He also noted that the average McDonalds does about 1369
  mln dlrs in revenues a year That compares with 11 mln dlrs a
  year for the average Burger King and 800000 dlrs a year for
  the average Wendys Since it cost about the same to build a
  single store for any one of these chains he said McDonalds
  can well justify their expansion
      Lee expects McDonalds to earn 440 dlrs a share in 1986
  and 515 dlrs in 1988 Last year it earned 372 dlrs a share
