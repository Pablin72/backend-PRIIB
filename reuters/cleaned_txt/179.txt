SWISS ECONOMY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION OECD SAYS
  Switzerlands economy combining low
  unemployment financial stability and a large external payments
  surplus is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory
  future the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
  Development OECD said
      This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight
  fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government it
  said
      The OECD in its annual report on Switzerland picked out
  some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pickup in
  inflation this year but said these gave no cause for concern
      The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product
  growth to 175 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986
  and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 125 pct after
  last years sharp fall to 075 pct from 36 pct in 1985
      But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest
  increase in the workforce leaving the unemployment rate
  unchanged at around one pct the lowest in the 24industrial
  nation OECD area
      Assuming an average exchange rate of 171 Swiss francs to
  the dollar this year against 169 in the second half of 1986
  the report forecast a 275 pct rise in exports and a 35 pct
  rise in imports this year after rises of 325 pct and 65 pct
  respectively in 1986
      The faster growth of imports compared with exports this
  year and last reflecting buoyant private consumption meant
  that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP
  would shrink in both years
      But given Switzerlands large external surplus there
  should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than
  GDPWhich if only in a small way would contribute to
  improving international balances the OECD said
      Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually
  buoyant last year with a 325 pct growth rate after several
  years of relative weakness it noted
      In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat
  to a 225 pct growth rate but should still outstrip overall
  GDP it added
      The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained
  bright into 1987 and with capacity use at near record levels
  last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation
  in both the industry and service sectors it said
      As a consequence growth in machinery and equipment
  investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year
  after vigorous growth in 1986
      But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for
  tourism and the banking industry two major service sector
  earners of foreign exchange
      The longterm appreciation of the Swiss Franc and the
  accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets could
  lead to a loss of international market share for both it said
      Particularly for the banks recent developments in
  international financial markets give rise to the question
  whether the Swiss financial system which has shown substantial
  flexibility in the past is adapting itself at the speed
  required  To preserve its competitive position it said
