PILLSBURY ltPSY HURT BY RESTAURANT OPERATIONS
  Pillsbury Corp reporting lower
  earnings for the third quarter ended February 28 said a strong
  performance by its Foods Group was offset by Restaurants Group
  declines

  profit was down in the quarter 12 pct from a year ago as sales
  rose four pct

  operating profit but profits fell sharply at Steak and Ale
  which introduced a new menu
      Pillsbury also reported lower profits at Distron Burger
  Kings distribution arm and said increased investment spending
  on developing concepts  QuikWok Bay Street and Key West Grill
   hurt results
      It said Foods operating profit excluding unusual items
  rose 10 pct with international operations and domestic breads
  and baking products major contributors to improvement in the
  quarter
      A turnaround in grain merchandising was a major factor in
  profit improvement for the nine months Pillsbury said
      Pillsbury said corporate expense showed a 43 mln dlr
  profit in the quarter reflecting a 105 mln dlr gain on the
  sale of a joint interest in an Australian food company and
  lower corporate expenses largely as a result of an early
  retirement program initiated a year ago

  mln dlrs or 56 cts a share down from 554 mln dlrs or 63 cts
  a share a year ago Sales advanced to 153 billion dlrs from
  146 billion dlrs
      Pillsbury said loss of investment tax credits under the
  1986 Federal Tax Reform Act reduced pershare earnings by nine
  cts in the quarter and 19 cts in the nine months
      As a result of the act it said its effective income tax
  rate rose eight points to 481 pct in the quarter and 55
  percentage points to 497 pct for the nine months
