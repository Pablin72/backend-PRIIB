INDONESIAN SUGAR OUTPUT SEEN SHORT OF TARGET
  Indonesias raw sugar output is likely
  to be 18 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 unchanged from 1986 and
  below the governments 1987 forecast of 25 mln the US
  Embassy said in its agricultural outlook for 1987
      Indonesia bought 162500 tonnes of raw sugar on world
  markets in late 1986 the report said
      The embassy estimated Indonesias calendar 1986 raw sugar
  production at 18 mln tonnes against a government estimate of
  199 mln
      It said that Indonesias move into sugar selfsufficiency
  in 1984 may have been shortlived
      The report said The government continues to promote
  sugarcane production through its smallholder intensification
  program and a relatively high guaranteed price to sugarcane
  producers
      However there are considerable indications that farmers
  are reluctant to plant cane because its economic return is not
  as good as that of other crops
