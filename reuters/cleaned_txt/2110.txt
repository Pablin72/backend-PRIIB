FRENCH OFFICIAL RESERVES FALL SHARPLY IN JANUARY
  French official reserves fell 4506
  billion francs to 37595 billion at the end of January from
  42100 billion at the end of December the Finance Ministry
  said in a statement
      It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreign
  currency that preceded the January 11 realignment of the
  European Monetary System EMS
      Foreign currency reserves fell by 891 billion francs
  during the month the ministry said
      This reflected outflows of 1026 billion francs through
  operations of the French exchange stabilisation fund
  counterbalanced by a gain of 135 billion francs resulting from
  the quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits held
  with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund FECOM
      But most of the decline reflected a 3390 billion franc
  deficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as a
  result of using very shortterm financing instruments
      The Bank of France in conjunction with the Bundesbank and
  other central banks intervened heavily in foreign exchange
  markets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord in
  an attempt to hold down the mark which was attracting a flight
  of funds from the dollar and simultaneously shore up the
  franc
      On January 11 the mark was revalued by three pct against
  the French franc relieving pressure on the French currency
      The fall in foreign exchange reserves took these reserves
  to 9883 billion francs at the end of January from 10774
  billion at end December
      Gold reserves were unchanged at 21845 billion francs
      Reserves of European Currency Units fell to 7325 billion
  francs from 7527 billion at end December
      Claims on the International Monetary Fund fell 219 mln
  francs to 1931 billion francs
