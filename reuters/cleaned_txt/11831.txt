INDIAN RATE CUTS TO SPARK INDUSTRY AGRICULTURE
  The Indian Finance Ministrys
  announcement in Parliament yesterday changing the nations
  interest rate structure will benefit industry and agriculture
  by providing loans at lower interest bankers and brokers said
      The changes effective today included reducing commercial
  bank lending rates that have ranged between 15 pct and 175 pct
  by one percentage point
      New rates which affect both Indian and foreign banks also
  include a one percentage point gain to an annual 10 pct on
  deposits of two years or more but less than five
      Bank deposits of five years or more carrying 11 pct
  interest have been abolished
      Bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect the
  governments concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and help
  improve world competitiveness of Indian goods
      There is likely to be a shift to shortterm bank deposits
  by longterm depositors bankers predicted This will create
  the flexibility to draw and reinvest funds in either equity
  shares or shortterm bank deposits they said
      A merchant banker also said reduced manufacturing costs due
  to lower lending rates are likely to boost the share market
      Tata Steel a trend setter on the Bombay Stock Exchange
  opened today higher at 1040 rupees against yesterdays closing
  of 101250 rupees
      A stockbroker said investors may be less enthusiastic now
  to buy convertible and nonconvertible debentures because the
  Finance Ministry has reduced the annual interest rate to 125
  pct and 14 pct respectively from 135 and 15 pct respectively
      But overall debenture prospects remain bright because the
  rates of interest on them will still be higher than what banks
  pay for deposits of similar maturity a merchant banker said
