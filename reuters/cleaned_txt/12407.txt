  West German industrial production
  seasonally adjusted rose a provisional 32 pct in February
  after a downwards revised decline of 34 pct in January the
  Economics Ministry said
      The ministry had originally estimated that industrial
  production fell 30 pct in January
      The February figure is likely to be revised upwards by just
  under one percentage point next month when the March figure is
  released a ministry statement said

  provisional 1041 in February against 1009 in January and
  1045 in December The ministry had previously put the January
  and December indices at 1016 and 1047 respectively
      In February 1986 the output index had stood at 1037
  producing a yearonyear rise for February 1987 of 04 pct
      The February rise in production was aided by a sharp 19 pct
  increase in construction output compared with January when
  production in many industrial sectors was depressed by
  unusually severe winter weather
      Manufacturing industry registered a 312 pct rise in
  production in February compared with January But energy sector
  output fell nine pct and mining production declined seven pct

  a better guide to trends said output in January and February
  together fell around two pct against November and December
      The ministry said construction output fell 1312 pct in
  JanuaryFebruary against NovemberDecember due to the cold
  January weather Output in the energy sector rose four pct and
  mining output 10 pct

  of food tobacco and alcohol fell 112 pct Production of
  capital goods fell 212 pct while output of consumer goods was
  unchanged

  production in January and February 1987 fell 112 pct the
  ministry said

  basic products down three pct capital goods down one pct and
