JAPANESE PURCHASE OF US HIGHTECH FIRM OPPOSED
  Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
  has asked the White House to consider blocking the planned
  Japanese acquisition of a major US Computer and semiconductor
  maker US Officials said yesterday
      The officials told reporters Baldrige had serious concerns
  on national security grounds about the sale of Schlumberger Ltd
  ltSLB unit ltFairchild Semiconductor Inc to Fujitsu Ltd
  ltITSUT The officials said the sale could leave the United
  States overly dependent on a foreign company for equipment used
  in advanced missiles aircraft electronics and intelligence
  gathering
      The US Officials added the sale would also worsen the
  strained relations between the two countries stemming from the
  huge Japanese trade surplus
      The White House Economic Policy Council would consider the
  sale in the coming weeks they said
      Defence Secretary Caspar Weinbergers position was not
  known but in the past he has opposed the transfer of high
  technology to foreign governments or companies
      Computers made by US Manufacturers are widely used in the
  world but Tokyo told US Negotiators recently it prefers
  local manufacturers and would not buy US Supercomputers
