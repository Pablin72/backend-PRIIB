ARGENTINE SOYBEAN YIELD ESTIMATES DOWN FURTHER
  Argentine grain producers again
  reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 198687
  soybean crop which will begin to be harvested in midApril
  trade sources said
      They said growers now forecast soybean production this
  season at between 75 and 78 mln tonnes down from last weeks
  estimate of 77 to eight mln tonnes and the 80 to 84 mln
  tonnes forecast in midFebruary
      The new forecast is still higher than last seasons record
  total production
      Private sources put 198586 production at a record 72 to
  73 mln tonnes  42 to 64 pct lower than the new forecast
  for the current crop The official figure for 198586 is 71
  mln tonnes 56 to 99 pct below this seasons new estimates
      Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods
  in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe
  provinces and northern Buenos Aires
      The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures
  and inadequate rainfall Growers fear they may find more empty
  pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield
      The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 37 to
  38 mln hectares 108 to 138 pct higher than the 198586
  record of 334 mln hectares
      The state of the crop continued to be good in general until
  last week but intense heavy rains since could have caused
  damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm
      Where the rains were less heavy they were considered
  beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates
      The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in
  southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to
  influence production forecasts
      In other areas especially western Buenos Aires where
  rainfall was more than 200 mm parts of the sunflower maize
  and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged
      The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by
  rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba La
  Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios
      The area sown with maize this season was between 358 and
  378 mln hectares two to seven pct less than the 385 mln
  hectares in 198586
      The yield of 198687 maize continued to be forecast at
  between 99 and 101 mln tonnes
      This estimate is 198 to 202 pct lower than the 124 to
  126 mln tonnes at which private sources put 198586 production
  and 211 to 227 pct lower than the official 128 mln tonnes
      The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the
  area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires
  although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods
      A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is
  impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of
  sunshine dries the fields
      The area sown this season was 20 to 22 mln hectares down
  299 to 363 pct on last years record 314 mln hectares
      Sunflowerseed 198687 production is still forecast at 23
  to 26 mln tonnes 341 to 415 pct below the 198586 record of
  41 mln tonnes
      The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the
  rains advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting
  in La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown
      The area sown was 123 to 130 mln hectares 103 to 152
  pct less than the 145 mln hectares the previous season
      Yield estimates remained at 32 to 35 mln tonnes 167 to
  22 pct down on 198586 production of 41 to 42 mln tonnes
