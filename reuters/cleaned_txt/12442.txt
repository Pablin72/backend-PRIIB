INDUSTRIAL ACTION ENDS AT SOUTH AFRICAN MINE
  About 8000 black miners returned
  to work after a weeklong industrial action at South Africas
  largest gold mine mine owner Anglo American Corp of South
  Africa Ltd ltANGLJ said
      A spokesman for the mining house said the action started on
  Wednesday last week when thousands of miners staged a goslow
  at One underground shaft of the Free State Geduld division of
  Free State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd ltFSCNJ
      The action later escalated into an underground sitin at
  the mine over the weekend prompting management to close the
  affected shaft because of what the company described as the
  creation of unsafe working conditions
      Anglo American spokesman John KingsleyJones said the
  company held talks with the National Union of Mineworkers
  NUM South Africas biggest trade union which claims a
  membership of 360000 black workers but failed to establish
  the cause of worker dissatisfaction He acknowledged that the
  mine suffered a loss of production but declined to give
  estimates
      Free State Consolidated last year produced 104 tonnes of
  gold from 28 underground shafts
      The NUM was not immediately available for comment on the
  action But a spokesman for the union earlier told the South
  African Press Association that miners had been locked out of
  the mine at the weekend after staging a strike in protest
  against being ordered to carry bags containing explosives as
  well as food for white miners
