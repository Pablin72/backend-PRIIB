S AFRICA GOLD MINING INDUSTRY HAD RECORD YEAR
  The gold mining industry had
  another exceptional year in 1986 with tonnage milled revenues
  and profits reaching high levels the Chamber of Mines said
      Nearly 108 mln tons of ore was milled three pct higher
  than the prior year while revenues rose 17 pct to 165 billion
  rand and profits increased 65 pct to 831 billion rand the
  Chamber reported
      The profit rise was achieved despite substantial cost
  increases and a 261 pct rise in capital expenditures to 242
  billion rand it said
      The chamber said that a comparatively buoyant gold price
  allowed mines to continue the practise of mining lower grade
  ores which has characterised recent years
      It said the industry now mines to an average grade of 563
  grams per ton compared with 609 grams per ton in 1985
      Gold output for the year declined five pct to 638 tons
  compared with the previous years 671 tons
