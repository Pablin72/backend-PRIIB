PARIS G6 MEET SET NO TARGETS  LEIGHPEMBERTON
  Bank of England Governor Robin
  LeighPemberton said the Paris pact agreed between six leading
  industrialised nations set no nominal exchange rate targets
      LeighPemberton said in oral evidence to a select committee
  that we did not swap numbers  we reached an understanding on
  how to cooperate towards stabilizing currencies at around their
  current levels
      He said the accord had brought Britain into a form of joint
  currency float  but one which let it still purse an
  independent monetary policy I would concede that since the
  Louvre Accord we are acting as if we are in something
  LeighPemberton said
      The Louvre and Plaza accords show there is a very effective
  role for the Group of seven central banks to operate together
  towards stabilising exchange rates LeighPemberton said
      He did not mention this weeks intervention by central
  banks to support the dollar after markets decided to test the
  accord
       LeighPemberton said that the effectiveness of this
  cooperation is actually larger than many of us had thought in
  the prePlaza days before September 1985
      He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly
  sought by the six nations and noted that we are more effective
  in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing

      LeighPemberton said that in principle the Bank of
  England favoured full EMS membership for sterling provided
  such a move did not endanger UK Antiinflation monetary
  policy Asked whether he wanted to see UK Interest rates
  lower he said the two half point cuts this month in banks
  base lending rates have been appropriate up until now
      LeighPemberton said he preferred a cautious stepbystep
  approach to reducing short term interest rates not least
  because we have a potential problem with inflation
      Underlying UK Inflation was currently around 40 pct one
  of the highest among industrialised nations he added
      LeighPemberton said the Bank of England had not wanted
  base rates to fall before the unveiling of the 198788 budget
  on March 17 but he said pressure from financial markets for
  such a move had proved irresistible Base rates are now at 10
  pct
      Regarding sterlings relationship with oil LeighPemberton
  said that the pound could be seen being undervalued overall
      He said the current oil price of some 18 dlrs a barrel
  might suggest a level of 74 on the Bank of Englands sterling
  index when compared with the indexs level before oil prices
  dropped from around the 30 dlr level The index base 1975
  closed here today at 721 unchanged from the previous close
