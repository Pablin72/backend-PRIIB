SUDAN REJECTS IMF DEMAND FOR DEVALUATION
  Sudan has rejected a demand by the
  International Monetary Fund for a currency devaluation because
  such a move would have a negative impact on its economy the
  official Sudan News Agency SUNA reported
      Finance Minister Beshir Omer quoted by SUNA said his
  government also rejected an IMF demand to lift state subsidies
  on basic consumer goods
      SUNA monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation
  said Omer made the remarks after a meeting in Khartoum
  yesterday with IMF envoy AbdelShakour Shaalan
      Sudan burdened by a foreign debt of 106 billion dlrs is
  some 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the IMF which declared it
  ineligible for fresh loans in February last year
      In February 1985 Sudan announced a 48 pct devaluation of
  its pound against the dollar adjusting the official exchange
  rate to 25 pounds to the US Currency
      Since then it has resisted pressure from main creditors
  for more currency adjustments arguing that past devaluations
  had failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices
  Sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollar
  for foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers
      Dealers in Khartoums thriving black market said the dollar
  was sold at 55 pounds today
      With stringent import regulations and the government
  increasingly short of foreign currency black market dollars
  are used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouring
  countries mainly Egypt Kenya Ethiopia and Zaire
      Western diplomats in Khartoum say the meetings between IMF
  and Sudanese government officials do not amount to formal
  talks but rather an effort by the IMF to monitor Sudans
  economic performance
      The diplomats said Sudan hoped a planned fouryear economic
  recovery program would be acceptable to the IMF as a serious
  attempt to tackle the countrys economic troubles and persuade
  its Gulf Arab creditors to pay the IMF arrears
      This they said could provide Sudan with a clean bill of
  health from the IMF that it could take to Western government
  creditors grouped informally in the socalled Paris Club to
  reschedule debt payments
      Twentythree pct of Sudans total foreign debt is owed to
  members of the Paris Club the diplomats said
      Sudans Finance Minister said last month the countrys IMF
  representative had told him the funds executive board was very
  pleased with the 185 mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the past
  couple of months
      The representative Omer Said said IMF Managing Director
  Michel Camdessus said he would ask Saudi Arabia to which Sudan
  owes about 14 billion dlrs to help Khartoum to pay more
      Sudan has an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrs
  but set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in the
  fiscal year ending next June 30
