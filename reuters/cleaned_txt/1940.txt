TAIWAN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES HIT NEW HIGH
  Taiwans foreign exchange reserves hit a
  new high of more than 51 billion US Dlrs on March 4 compared
  with 50 billion in midFebruary and 251 billion a year
  earlier the central bank said
      Bank governor Chang ChiCheng told reporters the increase
  came mainly from the banks purchases of more than one billion
  US Dlrs on the local interbank market between February 18 and
  March 4
      He said the rise showed signs of slowing however because
  Taiwan has liberalised import policy and expects its trade
  surplus to decline over the next few months as a result
      Chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise
  but local economists have forecast they will hit 60 billion
  US Dlrs by the end of 1987
      In January Taiwan reduced import tariffs of up to 50 pct
  on some 1700 foreign products It had been under growing US
  Pressure to cut its 1986 record 136 billion dlr trade surplus
  with the US Taiwans 1985 surplus with the US Was 102
  billion according to official statistics
      Wang ChangMing Vice Chairman of the Council for Economic
  Planning and Development told Reuters the government is
  planning another round of deep tariff cuts in the second half
  of this year
      The reserves could support imports of more than two years
  for Taiwan compared with about three months for Japan and the
  US
