CANAMAX PACIFIC TRANSOCEAN APPROVE PRODUCTION
  ltCanamax Resources Inc and ltPacific
  TransOcean Resources Ltd said they conditionally approved
  starting production at their jointly owned Ketza River gold
  deposit in the Yukon after a study recommended the move
      They said production was conditional on approval of a water
  license and arrangement of appropriate financing They
  estimated development costs for the mine and mill would total
  211 mln dlrs including three mln dlrs of working capital
      The feasibility study anticipated gold production of 49600
  ounces a year at a cost of 129 Canadian dlrs a short ton they
  said
      Canamax and Pacific TransOcean said the project would
  yield a 40 pct aftertax real rate of return at a gold price of
  400 US dlrs an ounce
      They said they would mine 460000 tonnes of proven and
  probable mineable reserves of oxide ore grading 045 ounce gold
  ton at a yearly rate of 112000 tonnes for a mine life of 425
  years
      Possible reserves of 75000 tonnes grading 038 ounce gold
  ton at the break zone would extend mine life by a year with
  considerable potential for development of further oxide ore
  reserves at the deposit they said
