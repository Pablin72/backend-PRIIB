TROPICAL FOREST DEATH COULD SPARK NEW DEBT CRISIS
  The death of the worlds tropical rain
  forests could trigger a new debt crisis and social and
  biological disasters scientists and ecologists involved with
  the International Tropical Timber Organisation ITTO said
      At stake is the ability of developing nations including
  Brazil Mexico and the Philippines to service their debts and
  the loss of trade worth hundreds of billions of dollars in
  important sectors such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals they
  said
      The experts gathering ahead of an ITTO meeting of
  consumers and producers near Tokyo next week said the problem
  is already acute
      The Philippines offers a textbook case of the economic
  dangers For many third world nations the loss of the forest
  is not just a loss of resources said Delfin Ganapin a
  Philippine government consultant on environmental impact
      In the 1960s we had 16 mln hectares of commercial forest
  now we have one mln We have only around 10 years of profitable
  logging left With a 26 billion dlr debt the loss of logging
  foreign exchange earnings is serious he said
      About 14 mln Philippine people depend on upland areas that
  are now denuded and farmers cannot grow crops
      Government security advisers say that as a direct result
  the most likely source of revolution in the Philippines is in
  the upland areas said Ganapin
      Replanting is uneconomic and replanted tropical hardwoods
  have less than a 50 pct chance of survival There is no known
  way to reproduce the wood or the millions of species within
      No replanting programme has been successful said Almy
  Hafild from the Indonesian Network for Forest Conservation
      Ganapin said three billion dlrs would be needed in the next
  two years alone to save five mln hectares of critically denuded
  land in the Philippines
      The experts say that without a major initiative from the
  development banks the vicious circle will continue with
  countries cutting more forest to help service shortterm debts
  at the cost of longterm insolvency
      Yet timber a five billion dlr a year industry is not
  necessarily the most direct economic product of the forests
  and nations must be educated in how best to farm them said
  Peter Kramer World Wildlife Fund WWF conservation director
      There is a four billion dlr annual global trade in the end
  products of rattan and Brazil nuts earn Brazil 16 mln dlrs a
  year he said
      US Pharmacologist Norman Farnsworth has calculated that
  25 pct of all US Prescriptions owe their active ingredients
  to higher plants growing in the forests
      Deforestation would wipe out the chance of further
  discoveries and force major corporations to research develop
  and produce manmade substitutes at a cost which scientists
  say is incalculable
      By the year 2000 only 10 developing nations will still be
  exporting timber from 33 currently and their export earnings
  will drop from a 1980 peak of 68 billion dlrs to less than two
  billion a World Bank and UN Sponsored survey said
      Of the 203 billion dlrs advanced by the World Bank
  InterAmerican African and Asian Development Banks in 198084
  only 100 mln dlrs went to forestry projects it said
      WWF statistics show half of the worlds tropical forests
  have vanished since the 1940s Of 2000 mln hectares remaining
  up to 16 mln are destroyed each year by destructive logging
  practises and by local farmers
