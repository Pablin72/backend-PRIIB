US SCIENTISTS SAY TROPICAL OILS HEALTH RISK
  US scientists said some tropical
  vegetable oils can be hazardous to consumers whose health is at
  risk because of high levels of saturated fat lending weight to
  a campaign by the American Soybean Association ASA for
  labelling changes
      The scientists appeared to support an ASA charge denied by
  Malaysian palm growers that imported coconut palm and palm
  kernel oils contain high levels of saturated fat and thus raise
  blood cholesterol and the risk of heart disease
      In a petition filed in January the ASA asked the US Food
  and Drug Administration FDA to require palm palm kernel and
  coconut oils to be identified as saturated fats on food
  manufacturers labels
      The FDA responded to the ASA in a letter saying it would
  consider the petition as a comment to a proposed rule dealing
  with cholesterol and fatty acid labelling of foods
      Malaysian oil palm growers have said the charges by the ASA
  that palm oil consumption increases blood cholesterol and
  contributes to heart disease are untrue
      But Steve Chang Professor of Food Science at Rutgers
  University said Palm oil is definitely not good for human
  health because it has a high content of saturated fatty acid
      He added that the higher the fatty acid the greater the
  blood cholesterol level It has been well established that
  high cholesterol levels will have a higher level of heart
  disease he said
      A Malaysian Oil Palm Growers Council official Borge
  BekNielsen has said studies have shown that palm oil is
  cholesterolfree low in saturated fats has anticancer
  properties and prevents blood clotting and blocking of arteries
  in humans
      BekNielsen said Americans consume more saturated fats
  daily through food like butter bacon ham and beef than from
  palm oil which he added is rich in vitamins A and E
      David Kritchevsky Associate Director of the Wistar
  Institute in Philadelphia appeared to take the ASA view on
  labelling What people really have to learn is to read labels
  said Kritchevsky The more a consumer knows the more likely he
  will make an intelligent choice
      The US scientists said they had no doubt imported palm
  palm kernel and coconut oils contain high saturated fat levels
      Kritchevsky a specialist in nutrition said More
  saturated fat would raise cholesterol levelsSo from that
  point of view its a health risk High cholesterol levels in
  the blood are a risk factor for heart disease
      Susanne Harris deputy assistant secretary of the US
  Agriculture Departments Food and Consumer Services Division
  said the health risk among consumers of vegetable oils with
  high saturated fat levels was highest among those who have
  heart disease
      The scientists said more than 50 pct of the fatty acid
  content of the tropical oils was saturated whereas less than
  20 pct of the fatty acid content of soybean oil was saturated
      David Ericksen director of ASAs technical services said
  US soybean producers could regain about onehalf of the 273
  mln dlrs in sales lost to imported tropical oils if consumers
  were aware the vegetable oils were high in saturated fat
      Imported tropical oils displace 171 mln bushels of US
  soybean sales in the US market ASA estimates
      US imports of coconut oil during January totaled 829 mln
  lbs compared with 480 mln lbs in December and 1065 mln a year
  earlier according to Commerce Department figures
      Imports of palm oil totaled 440 mln lbs compared with 513
  mln lbs in December and 852 mln a year earlier
