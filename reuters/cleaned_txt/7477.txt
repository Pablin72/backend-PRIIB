EC OFFICIAL FAULTS US TRADE BILL
  Sir Roy Denman Head of the EC
  Delegation in Washington said pending US trade legislation
  is a misguided attempt to deal with the nations trade deficit
  and will spark retaliation if passed in its present form
      To think that you can deal with a trade deficit by
  legislation is a mistake he told the Foreign Trade
  Association here
      Denman told reporters that possible retaliation which he
  warned of in a letter to House Ways and Means Committee
  Chairman Dan Rostenkowski would not necessarily be on a
  productforproduct basis
      Retaliation does not have to be matched product to
  product Denman said
      He said in the case of textiles import restrictions
  however retaliation would be against US textile exports
      Certainly if restrictions were imposed on European
  exports of textiles to the US the Community would be likely
  to retaliate with restrictions on US textile exports to
  Europe Denman said
      He also took exception to US proposals to require
  countries with large current account surpluses with the US to
  cut those surpluses or face special tariffs
      This would conflict with international obligations throw
  a large wrench into the current round of trade negotiations and
  could easily boomerang he warned of the tariff proposals
      Denman also took exception to US efforts to seek
  reciprocity in specific trade sectors
      Forcing reciprocity in one sector by imposing barriers
  would simply lead to retaliation from the other party he
  said adding that overall reciprocity can only be achieved by
  trading off disadvantages in one sector for advantages in
  another
