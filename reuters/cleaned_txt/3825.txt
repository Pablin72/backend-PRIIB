UK BANKS OFFER FIXEDRATE MORTGAGES AT 102 PCT
  Two major UK Clearing banks announced
  they will offer a total of 800 mln stg in new mortgages at a
  fixed interest rate of 102 pct for the first three years
  below current bank base lending rates of 105 pct
      Midland Bank Plc ltMDBLL said it has initially allocated
  500 mln stg for home loans at this rate while Lloyds Bank Plc
  ltLLOYL will offer 300 mln stg
      Earlier this week Midland said it would cut its standard
  rate of mortgage payment to 115 pct from April 1 following a
  half a percentage point reduction in leading banks base
  lending rates from 11 pct
      Building society and other bank mortgage rates are largely
  still well above the new base rate level although last year
  Lloyds offered a fixed rate of 99 pct on certain home loans
      A Midland spokesman said his bank calculated that at the
  current level of 27 billion stg its existing mortgage book
  accounts for about 5 pct of the total British home loan market
      Lloyds said it has 36 billion stg in outstanding mortgage
  loans but had not estimated its total market share
      Among other major clearing banks Barclays Plc ltBCSL and
  National Westminister Bank Plc ltNWBLL said they had no
  immediate plans to announce similar fixed rate schemes
