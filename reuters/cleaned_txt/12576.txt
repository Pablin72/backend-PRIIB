BANK OF SPAIN GOVERNOR SAYS MONEY GROWTH TOO FAST
  Bank of Spain governor Mariano Rubio said
  the central bank was worried that money supply was growing too
  fast reflecting excessive internal demand in the Spanish
  economy but added that he was confident recent measures would
  succeed in restricting money growth
      In testimony to the economic commission of Congress Rubio
  said the main measure of money supply the broadbased Liquid
  Assets in Public Hands grew at an estimated annualised rate of
  17 pct in March the same as in February
      The banks target range for growth in this measure in 1987
  is 65 to 95 pct compared with 114 pct last year
      Rubio said he was aiming for the lower end of the range
      He added that real GDP growth of three pct in 1986 was due
  to a six pct increase in real internal demand and a three pct
  real drop in the contribution of the external sector
      The aim for 1987 was for the same real growth in GDP but a
  drop in the internal contribution to 45 pct with the negative
  component of the external sector trimmed to 15 pct he said
