BRIERLEY BIDS 435 DOLLARSSHARE FOR PROGRESSIVE
  ltBrierley Investments Ltd BIL
  launched a full takeover bid for the supermarket group
  ltProgressive Enterprises Ltd at 435 dlrs a share
      BIL said in a statement the offer is conditional on minimum
  acceptances totalling 30 mln shares just under 25 pct of the
  1204 mln Progressive shares on issue
      Progressive is currently involved in a proposed merger with
  ltRainbow Corp Ltd Rainbow earlier this week raised its stake
  in Progressive to 52 pct BIL opposes the Rainbow merger and
  analysts say BIL needs a 25 pct stake in Progressive to prevent
  it occurring
      The merger involves shareholders in Progressive and Rainbow
  both receiving shares in a new company ltAstral Pacific Corp
  Ltd on a oneforone exchange basis
      The BIL bid is higher than the 420 dlrs BIL said it would
  offer when it first announced on Monday it would make a full
  bid for Progressive and it follows much public debate between
  BIL and Rainbow
      BIL Chief Executive Paul Collins said last week that he
  opposes the RainbowProgressive merger because BIL sees
  Progressive shares as being worth twice as much as Rainbows
  BIL has not disclosed how many Progressive shares it holds
      Rainbow has said the merger is soundly based Chairman
  Allan Hawkins said last week that BILs actions were aimed only
  at dirsrupting the merger and were not in the interests of
  Progressive shareholders
      Both Rainbows and Progressives boards have approved the
  merger proposal It has also been approved by the Commerce
  Commission but BILs bid is still subject to the Commissions
  scrutiny
      Progressive shares ended at 435 dlrs Rainbow at 342 and
  BIL at 417 at the close of New Zealand Stock Exchange trading
