YEUTTER CONCERNED ABOUT US EXPORT PICTURE
  US Trade Representative Clayton
  Yeutter said he expects imports to fall soon but he was
  concerned about the lack of improvement in US exports given
  the dollars decline in the last 18 months
      Im convinced were about to see an improvement on the
  import side Im more concerned about the export side he told
  a House Appropriations subcommittee
      Part of the blame goes on other countries which have not
  generated the economic growth to increase demand for US goods
  and part to some US companies which are not generating
  competitive exports he said
