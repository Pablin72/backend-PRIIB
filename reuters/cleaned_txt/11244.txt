  The Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow a
  total of 800 billion yen worth of financing bills from its
  holdings to help absorb a projected money market surplus of
  1700 billion yen money traders said
      Of the total 300 billion yen will yield 38992 pct on
  sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in a
  23day repurchase accord maturing on April 24
      The remaining 500 billion yen will yield 38990 pct in a
  31day repurchase pact maturing on May 2 they said
      The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 38750 pct
  onemonth commercial bill discount rate today and the 42811
  pct rate on onemonth certificates of deposit
      Tomorrows surplus is attributable to excess bank holdings
  from sales of yen to buy dollars and to huge cash amounts to be
  redeposited at banks after the current financial yearend
  today the traders said
      The operation will put the outstanding bill supply at about
  3200 billion yen
