BELGIUM REVISES DOWN 1987 GNP GROWTH FORECASTS
  The Belgian government has lowered its
  forecast for the nominal increase in gross national product in
  1987 to 35 pct from an originally forecast 39 pct Prime
  Minister Wilfried Martens said in a statement to parliament
      He said this revision which brings government forecasts
  more closely into line with those by private institutions
  takes account of an anticipated slowdown in the world economy
  and international trade
      But he said the impact on the Belgian economy will be
  limited due to recent agreements on wages and working
  conditions agreed by employers and unions
      Martens did not say how much the government expected GNP to
  grow in volume terms
      However last month the governments Planning Bureau said
  it had revised its 1987 forecast for this to 09 pct from 20
  pct
      In 1986 Belgiums gross national product rose 215 pct in
  volume terms against a 59 pct nominal rise
