US GOLD EAGLE SALES PROJECTED AT 31 MLN OUNCES
  American Eagle gold bullion coin
  sales are projected at 31 mln troy ounces in their first year
  on the market well above the target of 22 mln Donna Pope
  director of the US Mint told journalists
      World sales which began on October 20 1986 reached 2193
  mln ounces in less than six months of sales This made it world
  market leader with a share of 37 pct in 1986 Pope said
      Pope said that in volume terms nearly half of all gold
  Eagle sales were within North America roughly 40 pct were in
  Europe and about eight pct in Asia
      She said despite introduction of several new gold bullion
  coins on the market recently the Mint is aiming to preserve
  the Eagles strong market share with extensive publicity
      The Mint uses mainly newly mined US Gold for the coins
  as long as this is available at market prices The remaining
  gold is taken either from US Treasury stocks or from the
  open market Pope said
      Gold analysts said the Eagle is facing competition here
  from the Canadian Maple Leaf and also to a lesser extent from
  the South African Krugerrand Some estimated the Maple Leafs
  West German market share at 60 pct
      The figures may be distorted as many German investors buy
  gold bullion in Switzerland or Luxembourg to escape the 14 pct
  valueadded tax imposed here Including the tax the oneounce
  coins traded today at 906 marks they said
      Competition may also come from new gold coins including
  Belgiums ECU which began sales today Britain and Australia
  also have plans to mint gold bullion coins the analysts said
