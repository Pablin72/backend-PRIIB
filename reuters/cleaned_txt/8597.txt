TAIWAN COMPLAINS ABOUT SIZE OF RESERVES
  Taiwans foreign exchange reserves
  swollen by strong trade surpluses to a record 53 billion US
  Dlrs are becoming a problem government officials said
      Official figures show the latest level compares with the
  previous record of 51 billion dlrs on March 4 and about 26
  billion in late March 1986
      Central bank Governor Chang Chicheng told reporters the
  increase in reserves was the result of heavy intervention by
  the bank on the local interbank market It bought nearly two
  billion US Dlrs between March 5 and 23 he said
      Wang Chaoming vice chairman of the governments Council
  for Economic Planning and Development told Reuters the rising
  reserves were a big headache for Taiwan
      He said the government expects heavier pressure from the
  US Where protectionist bills are being proposed against
  nations such as Taiwan and Japan with large trade surpluses
  with the US
      Wang said the government would launch new measures within
  the next two months to further reduce import tariffs and open
  the market wider to foreign products especially those from the
  US
      Wang said the measures aim at helping reduce Taiwans trade
  surplus which rose to 273 billion US Dlrs in the first two
  months of 1987 from 202 billion a year earlier Nearly 90 pct
  of the surplus was with the US
      Vice Economic Minister Wang Chienshien agreed with Wangs
  remarks and said efforts to avert US Protectionism were
  running out of time We must do it quickly or face retaliation
  from Washington he said
      He said the measures would include removal of trade
  barriers on insurance and inland services for US Companies
      Chang Chicheng said the central bank could not stop buying
  US Dollars because of heavy sales by local exporters who fear
  the strong local dollar will cause them exchange losses
      He said the bank is studying revision of the foreign
  exchange rules in hope of further reducing currency controls
  but declined to give details
      The Taiwan dollar has risen about 15 pct against the US
  Dollar since September 1985 It opened at 3438 to the US
  Dollar today and is expected to rise further to 33 in June and
  to 32 by endyear some foreign bankers said
