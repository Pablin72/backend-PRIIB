US SETS CORN DEFICIENCY PAYMENT HALF PIK CERTS
  The upcoming fivemonth deficiency
  payments to corn and sorghum farmers will be made half in cash
  and half in generic commodity certificates a senior
  Agriculture Department official told Reuters
      Around 300 mln dlrs of the inkind certificates or
  certs will be mailed out to farmers around March 15 or 16
  Tom von Garlem Assistant Deputy Administrator for USDAs state
  and county operations said
      The decision to make the payments in a 5050 cashcerts
  ratio was made Monday but payments to producers will be
  delayed until midmonth due to a problem with USDAs computer
  program von Garlem said
  get 115 cts per bushel in this next payment  575 cts in
  certs and around 55 cts cash 575 cts minus GrammRudman
      Farmers who did not receive advance deficiency payments at
  signup will receive 63 cts per bushel Slightly more than half
  of this payment will be in cash von Garlem said but he said
  this will not markedly upset the 5050 ratio since most
  farmers got advance payments
      The final certificate payments will be very close to 300
  mln dlrs he said
      When asked if the Office of Management and Budget had
  resisted the cashcerts ratio the USDA official said that we
  proposed 5050 and OMB accepted it
