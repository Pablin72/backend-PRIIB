SWEDISH UNEMPLOYMENT DOWN AS DATA IS REVISED
  A new method of calculating Swedens
  unemployment figures reduced the number of jobless by a sixth
  a spokesman for the Central Bureau of Statistics SCB said
  reporting a substantial drop in the past year
      According to the revised data there were 94000 jobless in
  February representing 22 pct of the workforce against 120000
  or 28 pct of the workforce in February 1986
      SCB official Olle Wessberg said the new figures were based
  on a more extensive survey of the unemployed which brought
  Sweden into line with the practises recommended by the
  Genevabased International Labour Organisation
      Wessberg said the new method cut the number of unemployed
  by about 16 pct The way we are now collecting data is far more
  accurate and we are asking many more questions to find out
  whether the jobless want work whether they are able to work
  and whether they have actually looked for work he told
  Reuters
      The new method was first used for the January figures
  which showed unemployment dropping to 21 pct of the workforce
  from 27 pct old style in December but Wessberg said the
  change had apparently not been noticed by the press
      Recalculated according to the new method unemployment in
  February 1986 would have stood at 22 pct the SCB said
