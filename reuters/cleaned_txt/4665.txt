JAPAN REJECTS US OBJECTIONS TO FAIRCHILD SALE
  A Foreign Ministry official dismissed
  arguments made by senior US Government officials seeking to
  block the sale of a US Microchip maker to a Japanese firm
      They appear to be linking completely unrelated issues
  Shuichi Takemoto of the Foreign Ministrys North American
  Division told Reuters
      US Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the
  White House to consider blocking the sale of ltFairchild
  Semiconductor Corp to Japans Fujitsu Ltd ltITSUT US
  Officials said yesterday
      Baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave the
  US Military dependent on a foreign company for vital high
  technology equipment Pentagon officials said Defence Secretary
  Caspar Weinberger also opposes to the sale
      US Officials have also said the sale would give Fujitsu a
  powerful role in the US Market for supercomputers while
  Japans supercomputer market remains closed to US Sales
      Takemoto said national security should not be an issue
  since the planned purchase of Fairchild from its current owner
  Schlumberger Ltd ltSLB does not include Fairchilds main
  defencerelated division
      In addition Takemoto said tension over the supercomputer
  trade should not affect the sale as Fairchild does not make
  supercomputers
      Analysts noted that Fairchild does make sophisticated
  microchips used in supercomputers Fujitsu makes similar chips
  and supplies them to US Supercomputer makers they said
      Takemoto also dismissed US Fears that the proposed
  takeover would violate US Antitrust law saying the purchase
  would not result in Fujitsu monopolising the US Semiconductor
  market
      Two separate issues appear to have come together to boost
  pressure to block the purchase industry analysts said
      The move is in part an attempt to force Japan to open its
  domestic market to more US Supercomputer sales they said
      US Officials have repeatedly charged that the Japanese
  public sector is closed to US Supercomputer sales despite
  US Firms technological lead in the field
      The United States believes Japan will only react when
  bullied and this is a bullying ploy Salomon Brothers Asia
  analyst Carole Ryavec said
      However the analysts said more is at stake than
  supercomputer sales as the US Fears it is losing its vital
  semiconductor industry to Japanese competitors
      The real issue is xenophobia in the US Silicon Valley
  said Tom Murtha of brokerage James Capel and Co
      USJapanese tension over the semiconductor trade has
  failed to subside despite recent efforts by Japans Ministry of
  International Trade and Industry MITI to get Japanese firms
  to abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricing
  and opening Japans market
      A MITI official said that while Japan is faithfully abiding
  by the agreement problems remain in halting the sale of
  microchips in Europe and Southeast Asia at prices below those
  set by the pact
      It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem
  he told Reuters
      Despite the furore Fujitsu will proceed with talks on the
  acquisition in line with the basic agreement reached with
  Schlumberger last year a Fujitsu spokeswoman told Reuters
