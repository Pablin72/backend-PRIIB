SOVIET FIGURES SHOW ECONOMY STILL SHORT OF TARGETS
  The Soviet economy recovered slightly
  last month after a poor performance in January but major
  industries including oil and machinery are still short of
  production targets official figures show
      Central Statistical Board data published in the weekly
  Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta yesterday showed that industrial output
  was only up 08 pct in the first two months of 1987 over the
  same period of last year
      However the figure for January alone showed a fall in
  output of 01 pct from a year earlier Production is targetted
  to increase 44 pct for all of 1987
      The figures showed that only 77 pct of enterprises met
  their supply obligations in January and February
      Production of oil the countrys main export to Western
  nations hit 100 mln tonnes in January and February up from
  973 mln a year earlier and exceeded its target by 05 pct
      Economists said this reflected the huge investments poured
  into the oil sector in recent months in an effort to reverse
  the stagnation in production which began in November 1983
      Falling world oil prices last year helped cause a decline
  in Soviet trade with the West to 130 billion roubles from 1416
  billion in 1985
      Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta said labour productivity targets
  were also not fulfilled but did not give figures
      Economists said the overall data reflected exceptionally
  bad weather at the start of the year and stricter quality
  controls imposed on enterprises
      Production in the machinebuilding sector a priority in
  Moscows plans for economic renewal recovered slightly in
  February but was still 36 pct lower in the first two months of
  the year compared with the same period of 1986
      The figures showed that five republics produced less than
  in the first two months of 1986
