POSITIVE OUTLOOK TEMPERED IN US DEBT FUTURES
  Higher oil prices and stronger than
  expected US employment growth led to sharp losses in US
  interest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive
  chart outlook financial analysts said
      The increase of 319000 in nonfarm payroll employment
  during February was above market expectations for a rise of
  170000 to 200000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond
  futures that drove the June contract through key technical
  support at 101232 at the opening Friday they noted
      I dont like that fact that we had a close below 101
  said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner The 101232 level
  in the June bond contract had been the top of a threemonth
  trading range which when penetrated during the rally Wednesday
  led to bullish forecasts by chartists
      But analysts called it a false breakout on the weekly
  charts when the June bond closed at 1001032 Friday
      Some also forecast that the high of the week at 1011932
  may signal a bearish double top formation portending steep
  losses
      I tend to go along with the double top scenario said
  Northern Futures analyst Eileen Rico
      Rico noted that the possible formation along with the fact
  that the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures has
  occurred on relatively low volume were negative signals
      Despite what could be a negative chart outlook Leiner
  remains cautiously optimistic and June bonds should find
  support between 100 and 991632 next week
      The optimistic outlook as well as Leiners expectation
  that the yield curve will flatten in the near term is based on
  an improving inflation outlook
      With the dollar stable and economic data giving the Federal
  Reserve little room to ease monetary policy the inflation
  outlook is improving Leiner said and that should lead to
  relatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollar
  prices
      Still Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil prices
  remains a concern for the inflation outlook
      Oil rose during the week on reports that OPEC nations were
  maintaining production quotas and official prices and got an
  extra boost Friday due to the suspension of oil exports from
  Ecuador after an earthquake Thursday
      The runup in crude oil will be a shortlived phenomenon
  said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Brian Singer
      The rise in oil prices over the past week has been largely
  media induced Singer said He noted that even though OPEC
  production may be within quotas oil stocks are at
  tremendously high levels
      Although the Ecuador situation could cause a delay oil
  prices will eventually decline to the lows of late February he
  said and that will be a supportive influence for bond prices
