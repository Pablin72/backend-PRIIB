  mln dlrs or 65 cts a share
      The company said a drop in 1986 fullyear operating profit
  to 1501 mln dlrs from a restated 2527 mln dlrs in 1985 was
  due mainly to lower world oil prices

  income of 1194 mln dlrs compared with 1334 mln dlrs in 1985
  It said grain traffic recovered from droughtaffected levels of
  a year ago but was offset by weakness in other traffic areas
  and increased expenses
      It said the net loss from its Soo Line increased to 335
  mln dlrs loss from 87 mln dlrs loss in 1985 mainly due to
  restructuring charges

  recovery in tanker markets and a turnaround in the forest
