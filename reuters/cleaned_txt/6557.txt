HANDY AND HARMAN SEES SUFFICIENT SILVER SUPPLIES
  World stocks of silver are large
  enough to accommodate any changes in the supplydemand equation
  this year with industrial consumption expected to again exceed
  mine production the dealer house Handy and Harman said in its
  annual review of the silver market
      The house estimated that the industry last year withdrew
  20000000 ounces of silver from stocks to bridge a supply
  deficit caused by a consumption rate of 403000000 ounces and
  production level of 382000000 ounces
      However world stocks are huge totaling 2267900000
  ounces at the end of 1986 it said
      The review noted that world industrial consumption has been
  on an uptrend since 1980 although offtake is still 14 pct
  below the 1978 level of 442000000 ounces
      Handy and Harman said 22800000 ounces of silver were used
  to produce coins last year up from 12700000 ounces in 1985
  with the demand getting a big boost from the production of US
  coins including the American Eagle
      It also said that in recent years Communist countries have
  increased their silver imports and estimated that China and
  East Germany alone took in 70000000 ounces of foreign silver
  in the last five years
