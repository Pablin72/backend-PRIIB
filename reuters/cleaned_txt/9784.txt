UK TRADE FIGURES BUOY HOPES OF INTEREST RATE CUT
  The release of UK February trade data
  showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376
  mln stg up from a 73 mln surplus in January has boosted hopes
  of an early cut in interest rates analysts said
      Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome with
  expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750
  mln stg against the official figure of 224 mln stg sharply
  narrower than Januarys 527 mln deficit
      The figures are unreservedly good Chase Manhattan
  Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said
      Sterling rebounded on the trade figures reversing a weaker
  morning trend to stand at 721 pct of its trade weighted index
  against a basket of currencies at midday unchanged from
  yesterdays close but 03 points above the 1100 GMT level
      The market had feared that a deteriorating nonoil trade
  pattern would undermine international support for sterling
  which has been the motor behind the recent fall in UK
  Interest rates Money market sources said the market had begun
  to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates
  to 95 pct from the present 100 pct was really on the cards
      But sentiment now looks to have turned about again
      There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the
  Exchequer Nigel Lawsons forecast of a 1987 current account
  deficit of 25 billion stg will be exceeded Wroblewski said
      Seasonally adjusted figures showed imports rose in February
  to 716 billion stg from 673 billion in January
      Exports rose to a record 693 billion from 620 billion
      However Chris Tinker UK Analyst at brokers Phillips and
  Drew said the faster rise in exports than imports would prove
  partly aberrational in coming months He forecast the
  Chancellors Budget tax cuts would increase consumer
  expenditure on imported goods
      However Warburg Securities economist Ian Harwood said his
  firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit
  forecast in the light of the latest data cutting one billion
  stg off the expected full year total to about 175 billion stg
      He said news of strong growth in exports of nonoil goods
  confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the
  Confederation of British Industry
      The growth in imports appears to be flattening even if
  Januarys bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas
  goods and importintensive stock building among manufacturers
  Harwood said
      UK Government bonds or gilts surged by more than 12
  point on the betterthanexpected news as earlier worries
  about the figures evaporated
      Sterling peaked at a high of 16075 dlrs before settling
  to a steady 16050 about 1300 GMT nearly a cent higher than
  the European low of 15960
      However analysts noted that the turnabout in market
  sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news
      Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was
  largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the
  Conservative governments support was slipping
      LONDON March 26  The Bank of England said it provided 15
  mln stg in assistance to the money market this morning buying
  bank bills in band two at 91316 pct
      Earlier the Bank revised its money market liquidity
  forecast from a flat position to a deficit of around 350 mln
  stg
