PESSIMISM MOUNTS OVER BAHIAN TEMPORAO COCOA CROP
  Pessimism over the effects of a
  prolonged dry spell on the coming Bahian temporao cocoa crop is
  rising with trade forecasts generally in the 20 mln to 25 mln
  bag range against 25 mln to 30 mln a fortnight ago
      Trade sources told Reuters from the state capital of
  Salvador that despite scattered rains since midFebruary which
  broke a six week drought plantations have not picked up as
  hoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in the
  first three months of the MaySeptember crop
      The sources said arrivals from May through July might only
  reach around 600000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of
  10 mln to 15 mln bags might be expected
      Arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as pods
  from current flowering are gathered However the sources noted
  a late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot which
  flourishes if conditions turn cold and humid and which is more
  likely from late July on
      This years crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices
  mean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and
  insecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot
      A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over
  500000 bags in a very short period one source said
      Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage
  estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely
  vulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 20
  mln bag mark if the disease hits
      Although flowering was good following the start of the
  rains pod setting was not up to expectations possibly because
  the drought had caused a drop in the insect population which
  pollinates flowers the sources said
      However reports from farms indicate moisture levels are
  now generally back to near normal levels and that current
  flowering and pod setting is good which should result in
  mature fruit from August through September
      The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of
  beans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the
  main crop which officially starts on October 1
      The cutoff date is completely artificial If things go
  well from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break
  from August through November or even December one said
      If predictions of a 20 to 25 mln bag temporao prove
  accurate this would be below the 27 mln bag average for the
  past 10 years The last poor temporao was in 1984 when
  prolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 179 mln
  bags the lowest since 1974
      Good growing conditions the following year produced a
  temporao of 312 mln bags just below the 1983 317 mln bag
  record while last years output which also suffered some
  drought damage was 277 mln bags
      Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards
  by the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans
      The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to
  have been undeclared from this years record total harvest and
  they were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the
  end of the official crop year on April 30
      Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the
  inclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port
  warehouses but not declared
      Because of the high turnover of beans this year
  significant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored
  too long at the back of warehouses Some of these are expected
  to be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals
      With official arrivals figures for the 198687 temporao and
  main crops totalling over 61 mln bags and over seven weeks
  still to go to the end of the year the total outturn should be
  at least a record 65 mln bags if all production is declared
  the sources said
      This would compare with the previous record set last year
  of 603 mln
      However there is no way of telling how many current crop
  beans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao
  and thus the true size of the 198687 harvest may never be
  officially registered
