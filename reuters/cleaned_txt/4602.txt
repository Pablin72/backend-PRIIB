FED DATA INDICATE NO POLICY CHANGE LIKELY
  US bank reserve monetary and
  discount window borrowings data released by the Federal Reserve
  today clearly indicate that policy is on hold and may not be
  changed for weeks or even months economists said
      The Fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is not
  about to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurs
  on the economy said John Williams of Bankers Trust Co
      These numbers contain no hint that a policy shift is in
  prospect nor do economic or financial developments argue for
  policy change said William Griggs of Griggs and Santow Inc
      Fed data released today were all in line with economists
  expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks
      The Fed said net discount window borrowings in the two
  weeks ended Wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs up from 381 mln
  dlrs in the February 25 statement period but little changed
  from 160 mln dlrs in the period before that
      It said that banks net free reserves in the latest two
  weeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously
      Finally the Fed said that the M1 money supply fell 800
  mln dlrs in February with the broader M2 measure down 16
  billion dlrs and M3 up an even three billion dlrs
      Analysts said that M1 last month grew at a negative 13
  pct annual rate compared with minus 07 pct for M2 and actual
  positive growth of 10 pct annualized for M3
      February levels of M2 and M3 left the aggregates 182 and
  208 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limits
  set by the Fed for 1987 The annual growth target for both is
  512 to 812 pct There is no M1 target
      In the near term there is absolutely no reason for the
  Fed to ease policy even apart from the slowdown in money
  growth said Stephen Slifer economist at Lehman Government
  Securities Inc
      Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetary
  growth in March after Februarys anemic growth rates However
  they stress that money growth will not be strong enough to
  prevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if the
  economy shows evidence of weakness
      Commenting on Februarys decline in the key M2 aggregate
  Slifer said the main cause was a 32 billion dlr drop in money
  market deposits at banks This number has risen three to four
  billion dlrs a month for a long while he said so Februarys
  weakness is not likely to persist Slifer expects modest M2
  and M3 growth rates of 312 to four pct during March
      Griggs said that M2 and M3 in coming months should return
  to the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so
  continue to present no problem for the Fed
      Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable with
  its current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps
  several more months of economic data before deciding whether or
  not to ease its grip on reserves
      Given the economys fragility in many sectors the analysts
  agreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will choose
  to raise rather than lower interest rates when it next
  changes policy
      Discount window borrowings in the past week were about as
  low as the Fed can get them although Fed funds held above six
  pct said Williams of Bankers Trust Funds averaged 612 pct
  in the week to Wednesday up from 606 pct in the prior week
      The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of
  customer repurchase agreements last Friday 25 billion dlrs on
  Monday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday On Tuesday it added
  reserves directly through twoday System repurchases
      Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds rate
  be largely marketdriven They said it is focusing instead on a
  borrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs
