LYNG SAYS NO DECISION ON SOVIET EEP OFFER
  US Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng said the Reagan administration had not decided on offering
  the Soviet Union subsidized wheat but that such an offer had
  not been ruled out
      In an interview with Reuters Lyng also said that he had no
  knowledge of any upcoming discussion of the matter within the
  cabinet
      Asked if the administration had ruled out offering to
  subsidize wheat exports to the Soviet Union under the
  departments export enhancement program Lyng said No We
  havent made a decision on it havent even talked about it
  havent even looked at it
      Reminded that there have been reports that Moscow would buy
  US wheat if competitively priced Lyng responded If they
  the Soviets would offer to buy some wheat would we accept
  it It would depend on what price they offered
      Lyng added that he did not think the price of US wheat
  was far off the world price
      Asked about persistent speculation that the administration
  would offer Moscow a wheat subsidy Lyng said Some people
  think theyre doing it to see if they can get a little spurt in
  the market
      Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz last week asked
  the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to investigate reports
  that wheat prices were being manipulated by reports that a US
  wheat subsidy offer was imminent
