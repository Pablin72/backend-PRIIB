LOWER US SOYBEAN LOAN IDEA SHARPLY CRITICIZED
  US soybean lobbyists and
  congressional aides criticized a proposal from a senior
  Agriculture Department official that Congress allow the US
  soybean loan level to be officially lowered to 456 dlrs per
  bushel next year
      I dont know who in Congress would propose that happening
  Politically it would be totally unacceptable an aide to a
  senior farmstate senator said
      USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said this week that
  Congress should give USDA authority to keep the soybean loan 
  at its current effective rate of 456 dlrs per bushel rather
  than increasing it to its minimum allowed level of 477 dlrs
      Im convinced that Congress will not go along with this
  American Soybean Association President Dave Haggard said
      Amstutz told reporters following a senate hearing that if
  the soybean loan rate were 456 dlrs USDA could then consider
  ways to make US soybeans more competitive
      His comments were seen as possibly indicating what the  the
  administrations position is in the debate over what should be
  done to make soybeans competitive and at the same time protect
  soybean farmers income
      Using soybean specific certificates to further buydown the
  loan rate or implementation of a marketing loan have been
  pointed to as the most effective ways to get soybean prices
  competitive USDA secretary Richard Lyng however continues to
  maintain his opposition to a marketing loan saying such a move
  would be too costly
      There will be alot of other options that will be
  considered before Congress looks at that one the Amstutz
  proposal said Bill OConner aide to Rep Edward Madigan
  RIll ranking minority leader of the Agriculture Committee
      Anybody representing large groups of soybean producers
  would not be very excited about supporting a lower soybean
  loan OConner said
      Congress may very likely look at the soybean loan and
  decide that they cannot increase it from its current 502 dlr
  basic rate but that there has to be something mandated to
  increase soybeans competitiveness David Graves aide to Sen
  Thad Cochran RMiss said Cochran a staunch supporter of a
  soybean marketing loan would support a soybean loan of 502 or
  477 dlrs with a certificate buydown Graves said
