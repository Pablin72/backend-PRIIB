LYNG DISAPPOINTED BY CANADA CORN INJURY DECISION
  US Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng said he is very disappointed by a Canadian government
  finding that US corn has injured Ontario Corn growers
      This action is not helpful in the context of the ongoing
  USCanada free trade talks or in the new round of
  multilateral trade negotiations Lyng said in a statement
      The Canadian government today said Ottawa would continue to
  apply a duty of 849 cents per bushel on US corn imports
      Lyng said the US made a case that US corn imports are
  not the cause of any problem of Canadian corn producers adding
  that US corn exports to Canada are declining
      Apparently they Canada have ignored the fact that
  Canadian corn and other coarse grain production is rising
  faster than consumption Lyng said
