TRADERS CUT BAHIA TEMPORAO COCOA CROP ESTIMATE
  Trade estimates of the coming
  MaySeptember temporao harvest in Brazils main cocoa growing
  state of Bahia are now in the 15 mln to 20 mln 60kilo bag
  range against 20 mln to 25 mln two weeks ago
      Traders in the state capital Salvador told Reuters the
  effects of a dry period in the first six weeks of the year had
  been harsher than thought earlier
      Although good flowering had followed the onset of rains in
  midFebruary subsequent pod setting was dissappointing
      Last years temporao also hit by a dry spell was 277 mln
  bags In 1984 severe drought cut the crop to 179 mln bags
      The traders said another factor leading to lower crop
  predictions is that many farmers are not caring properly for
  plantations because of low returns on their investment
      Manpower fertiliser and other costs have been cut back as
  farmers feel the pinch of the rise in interest rates over the
  past six months coupled with low bean prices
      If such economies continue into the winter months both the
  temporao and the developing OctoberApril main crop could face
  serious damage from pod rot attacks on trees which would
  normally be treated against the disease
      Recent very wet weather has already caused some isolated
  incidences of pod rot but reports from the growing regions say
  these are not yet significant
      The traders said they expect very low deliveries of
  temporao beans in the first three months of the harvest and the
  bulk will not appear until the last month September
      Despite the low loads trees are said to be in excellent
  condition and recent flowering and pod setting  which will
  lead to late temporaoearly main crop beans  has been good
