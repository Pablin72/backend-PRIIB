VEGETABLE OILS MAY TIGHTEN DESPITE SEED SURPLUS
  Lower production of coconut
  and palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocks
  this year despite growing supplies of oilseeds senior oilseeds
  analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said
      Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at Alberta
  Agricultures annual farm outlook conference that the world
  vegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies
      Prices for edible oils appear to have more upside
  potential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedented
  decline in the production of tree oils Balletto said
      Balletto estimated production of palm coconut and palm
  kernel oils this year at 85 mln tonnes down from 91 mln
  tonnes last year enough to offset higher oilseed output
      He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at
  334 mln tonnes up from 330 mln last year and disappearance
  at 340 mln tonnes up from 326 mln
      Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply he said
  disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by
  600000 tonnes the largest deficit since 1976
      If world protein meal demand stagnates thus limiting the
  crush of soybeans  the need for serious supply rationing in
  the edible oils sector could develop he said
      This would be relatively favorable for the prices of high
  oil yielding seeds Balletto said
      Oilseeds on the other hand remain at depressed prices
  because of burdensome supplies he said
      World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increase
  for the fourth straight year to a record 284 mln tonnes
  compared with 254 mln last year
      The increase should result from lower disappearance as
  production is expected to fall to 1840 mln tonnes from 1857
  mln last year he said
      World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 989 mln
  tonnes up from 906 mln the previous year Balletto said
  while production of other oilseeds was lower
      Higher soybean production in South America and Europe made
  up for lower production in the United States he said
      Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus and US
  stocks make up most of those Balletto said
      The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 127 mln tonnes
  about half of the world soybean surplus he said
      Since 198384 he said world oilseed stocks have increased
  131 mln tonnes
      During the same period US soybean stocks increased 121
  mln tonnes becoming the dumping ground of the entire world
  surplus courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificially
  high prices caused by the US loan program
      Soybean prices and to a great extent world oilseeds
  prices are likely to be dominated by the loan program as long
  as the US soybean surplus continues
      For the 1987 crop he said prices are likely to hover in a
  range tied to the US loan program
      Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supply
  overhang while strong underlying support is provided by the
  US loan rate
      The problem is likely to become worse as the artificially
  high prices encourage producers in South America Canada and
  Australia to shift from grains to oilseeds Balletto said
