US PRICE DATA SUGGEST MODERATE INFLATION
  Latest consumer price data indicate
  US inflation will be moderate in 1987 even though it will be
  above last years pace economists said
      Inflation is not such a constructive factor as this time
  last year but its not building up a large head of steam
  said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp
      US consumer prices as measured by the consumer price
  index for all urban consumers rose a seasonally adjusted 04
  pct in February after a 07 pct January gain Energy prices
  which fired Januarys data with a three pct rise advanced a
  more moderate 19 pct last month
      The CPI came within the range of economists expectations
  and had little direct impact on US financial markets
      Among the key components of the report transportation
  prices rose 05 pct in February after a 15 pct January gain
  reflecting smaller price appreciation for motor fuels and
  declines in new car prices and finance charges
      There are no pronounced pressures at the retail level
  said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc
      Economists said the latest CPI supports existing
  expectations for an inflation rate of 35 to four pct in 1987
      The CPI rose 11 pct from December 1985 to December 1986
  Without last years energy price drop it rose 38 pct
      Economists said that upward pressure on import prices as a
  result of the dollars drop as well as the volatile energy
  component warrant attention in case gains in these areas become
  factored into the wider economic picture
      As long as those price rises do not become entrenched in
  cost of living adjustments contained in labor contracts thus
  reducing international competitiveness then the Federal
  Reserve would probably be willing to tolerate four pct
  inflation said Larry Leuzzi of SG Warburg and Co Inc
