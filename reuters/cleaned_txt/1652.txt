ESTIMATED FRENCH BARLEY STOCKS WORRYING  ONIC
  The size of French 198687 carryover
  barley stocks estimated at 172 mln tonnes compared with
  700000 tonnes in 198586 is worrying French Cereals
  Intervention Office ONIC Director Bernard Vieux said
      He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at the
  end of February from the previous month while export forecasts
  were lowered to 45 mln tonnes from 576 mln in 198586
      Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding a
  larger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets are
  opened for French barley a large amount could be put into
  intervention
      A small amount of French barley has already been put into
  intervention Vieux said without detailing the amount
      The outlook for French maize is better with 198687 exports
  to nonEC countries now put at 700000 tonnes against 200000
  tonnes at the end of January and against 155000 tonnes in
  198586
      The higher estimate is due to the EC Commissions decision
  to hold special export tenders for French maize he said
