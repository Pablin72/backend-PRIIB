UK MONEY MARKET OFFERED BORROWING FACILTIES
  The Bank of England said it had offered
  borrowing facilities to those discount houses wishing to use
  them at 1430 GMT
      The Bank also said it provided the money market 456 mln stg
  assistance in the afternoon session bringing its total help so
  far today to 493 mln stg This compares with its forecast of a
  shortage in the system today of around 700 mln stg
      The central bank purchased bank bills outright comprising
  41 mln stg in band one at 1078 pct 361 mln stg in band two at
  101316 pct and 54 mln stg in band three at 1034 pct
      Money market dealers said the Bank of England has recently
  used the offer of borrowing facilities to signal that it does
  not want to see an early reduction in UK Base lending rates
      The Bank does this by lending to the discount houses at
  rates of interest higher than its prevailing money market
  dealing rates
