ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT  JAPAN PUSHES ITS CHIPMAKERS
  Japanese microchip makers are being
  strongarmed into compliance with a USJapan pact on
  semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japans
  market to foreign chips industry analysts said
      But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of
  International Trade and Industry MITI which is pressuring
  the firms can successfully battle market forces and whether
  the US Industry is geared up to take advantage of any
  breathing space they said
      US Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September
  have pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese
  chipmakers to abide by the pact the analysts said
      MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry
  to get things done said Bache Securities Japan associate
  vice president Peter Wolffe
      Last month MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the
  January to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive
  chips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject
  to the pacts price controls
      The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide
  distributors with certificates designating them as authorised
  exporters in an effort to close loopholes through which grey
  marketeers sneak chips out of Japan market analysts said
      US Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in
  jeopardy because of continued dumping in nonAmerican markets
  and little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan
      But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the
  production cuts several analysts said Last week NEC Corp
  said it would cut production in line with MITIs request
      NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITIs
  demands said David Keller analyst at James Capel and Co Once
  NEC cuts production it means they all have
      Still pressures remain to keep production high Japanese
  firms need high output to cut unit prices for US Sales that
  the Commerce Department assigns them under the pact
      The best way to lower cost is to produce more said Salomon
  Brothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec
      Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also
  spur higher production next quarter Merrill Lynch analyst Matt
  Aizawa said
      Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new
  restrictions some industry officials said
      Its like tax avoidance schemes said Steve Donovan head
  of MMI Japan KK As soon as you close one route another
  opens
      MITIs pressure has annoyed some makers who had earlier
  shrugged off MITI guidance
      Its getting to be like communism said one
      But analysts said output cuts could help by making it
  easier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcing
  firms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss
      Theyre going to have to start running their businesses
  like businesses Baches Wolffe said
      MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaign
  urging chip users to buy foreignmade chips but US Industry
  officials said response has been mixed at best
      There has been some change but its not across the board
  said one US Spokesman The companies have a varying degree of
  urgency
      The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on the
  troubled US Industry remains in doubt analysts added
      Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM dynamic
  random access memory chips could merely speed the transition
  to one megabit chips where Japan now leads analysts said
      Whether US Firms are able to stage a comeback in memory
  chips or interested in doing so also remains unclear they
  said
      Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new US
  Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing the
  most advanced technology for microchip manufacturing
      Even in the thorny area of access much depends on US
  Commitment as well as on Japanese openness some said
      The SIA US Semiconductor Industry Association doesnt
  even have an office here a source close to the industry said
  You could question just how committed they are
      In addition some industry analysts question the
  effectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out third
  country chipmakers such as those in South Korea
      South Koreas gaining market share said one analyst
  Theyre the real winners from the agreement
