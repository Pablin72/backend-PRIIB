1987 US SOYBEAN LOAN SHOULD STAY SAMEAMSTUTZ
  Congress should give the US
  Agriculture Secretary the authority to keep the 1987 soybean
  loan rate at the current effective rate of 456 dlrs per bushel
  in order to help resolve the problem of soybean export
  competitiveness USDA undersecretary Dan Amstutz said
      Speaking to reporters following a Senate Agriculture
  Appropriations hearing Amstutz suggested that one way out of
  the current soybean program dilemma would be for Congress to
  allow the loan rate to remain at 456 dlrs He indicated if the
  loan rate were 456 dlrs USDA could then consider ways to make
  US soybeans more competitive such as using certificates to
  further buydown the loan rate
      Under current law the 1987 soybean loan rate cannot be
  less than 477 dlrs per bu
      Amstutz suggestion would be for Congress to change the
  farm bill to allow USDA to leave the soybean loan rate at 456
  dlrs in crop year 1987 rather than increase it to 477 dlrs
      The 1986 effective loan rate is 456 dlrs because of the
  43 pct GrammRudman budget cut
      Amstutz stressed that a major factor in any decision on
  soybean program changes will be the budget costs
      He told the hearing that the problem in soybeans is that
  the US loan rate provides an umbrella to foreign production
  and causes competitive problems for US soybeans
      Asked about the American Soybean Associations request for
  some form of income support Amstutz said the competitive
  problem is the most severe He said USDA is still studying the
  situation and no resolution has yet been found
