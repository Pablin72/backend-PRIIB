SPAIN RAISES CALL MONEY RATES ON HIGHER DEMAND
  The Bank of Spain raised overnight call
  money rates by 14 to 14 pct on demand for 746 billion pesetas
  in todays auction which a bank spokesman termed heavy
      Rates stood at 121 pct at the start of the year and have
  been increased to drain liquidity on rising demands for funds
  the spokesman said
      He said in reply to Reuters inquiries that rates could rise
  further if money supply growth rose above this years eight pct
  target for M4 defined as liquid assets in public hands
      Money supply rose at an annualised rate of 167 pct last
  month against 81 pct in January Growth was 114 pct in 1986
      A leading Spanish broker said the central bank was applying
  a more restrictive policy to keep the lid on inflation
      The consumer price index rose 83 pct last year
      Money supply control is the governments chief weapon
  against inflation he said The problem is higher rates are
  attracting liquidity from abroad
      He said this was why the central bank enacted specific
  measures to control the inflow of foreign capital The Bank of
  Spain earlier this month imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement
  on new convertible peseta funds held by banks to curb
  shortterm speculative capital from abroad
