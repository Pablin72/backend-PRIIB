PIONEER GROUP ltPIOG UNIT GETS MORE LAND
  The Pioneer Group Inc said its 70
  pctowned Teberebie Goldfields Ltd venture has been granted an
  additional concession of land in Ghana to look for and mine
  gold
      The State Gold Mining Corp of Ghana granted the venture an
  additional 145 square kilometers in Teberebie Ghana
  contiguous to 115 square kilometers granted earlier the
  company said
      The original concession appears to have a substantial
  amount of gold bearing material containing about 2 grams or
  6100 ounces of gold per metric ton
      But the venture has no firm estimates on the costs of
  extracting the gold and no assurances can be given that the
  reserves can be mined profitably the company said
      It said Teberebie Goldfields has not conducted tests on the
  newly granted land but added the land seems to be similar in
  geological characteristics to the original land
