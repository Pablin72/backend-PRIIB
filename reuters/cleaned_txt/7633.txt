VOLCKER SAYS TRADE DEFICIT IS MAJOR CHALLENGE
  Federal Reserve Board
  Chairman Paul Volcker said the US Trade deficit is a
  challenge for the US Equal to the Soviet Union launching of
  Sputnik
      The international challenge implicit in our huge trade
  deficit has become the 1980s equivalent to the launch of
  Sputnik by the Russians in the 1950s when we suddenly feared
  we were to be left in the wake of Soviet technological
  achievement he said in an address to Florida educators
       He said the trade problem underscored the need to reform
  the US Educational system to improve economic performance
      The Commerce Department reported last week that the
  nations trade gap calculated on a balanceofpayments basis
  swelled to a record 3837 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter
  bringing the 1986 deficit to a record 14771 billion dlrs
      Volcker called on educators to stress the development of
  basic reading writing and mathematics skills and urged them to
  help students adapt to the fastchanging economic climate
      Volcker said the challenge was greatest in the education of
  lowincome minority groups such as blacks and Hispanics
