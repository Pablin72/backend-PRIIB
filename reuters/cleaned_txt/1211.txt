  Visible stocks of 17 oils and fats are
  probably peaking now and are likely to fall sharply by October
  1 this year the Oil World newsletter said
      Oil World forecast that stocks of oils and fats may be cut
  to only 98 mln tonnes at the end of this season compared with
  106 mln a year earlier
      Its survey covered  13 oils  soy cotton groundnut sun
  rape sesame corn olive coconut palmkernel palm lin and
  castor   and four animal oils and fats  butter fish oil
  lard and tallowgreases
      Oil Worlds analysis predicted only a slight production
  increase of 05 mln tonnes in the year to endSeptember 1987
  compared with increases of 36 mln and 40 mln tonnes in the
  previous two seasons
      It said world consumption was continuing to rise Unusually
  low prices prevailing since early 1986 had stimulated demand
  for both food and nonfood purposes it said
      World consumption  could increase by a record 28 mln
  tonnes to 718 mln tonnes this season and would be even higher
  if the Indian government did not artificially curb domestic
  demand

  EC to introduce a vegetable oils tax but if such a tax were
  introduced it would have a negative impact on EC consumption
