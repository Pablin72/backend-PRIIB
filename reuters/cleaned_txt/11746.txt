ANALYSTS SEE SLOW MOVE TO HIGHER US PRIME RATE
  Quarterpoint prime rate increases to
  734 pct by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank today will be
  followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of
  the Federal Reserves policy intentions economists said
      Based on the spread between banks cost of funds and the
  prime rate it probably makes sense for others to follow but
  no rush is likely said Paul McCulley of EF Hutton and Co
      Citibanks surprise base rate increase quickly followed by
  Chase sent US bond prices lower and the dollar higher
      McCulley said that once the spread between threemonth
  certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than
  112 percentage points there is a strong chance of a prime
  rate increase It has been under 114 points recently
      However banks are likely to hold rate increases until they
  see what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the near
  term analysts said They noted that banks historically like to
  follow Fed rate movements rather than lead them For example
  the last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when banks
  lifted the rate to 13 pct from 1212 pct after a Fed discount
  rate increase in April of that year
      Major banks had been posting a 712 pct prime rate since
  last August 2627 when they lowered the rate from eight pct
  shortly after the Feds halfpoint discount rate cut to the
  current 512 pct level on August 20
      The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates There
  should be a split prime for a while with some posting a 712
  pct rate and others 734 pct said David Jones of Aubrey G
  Lanston and Co
      Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at todays
  meeting voted no change in Fed policy But he said the Fed may
  well foster higher interest rates soon
      Jones said that while the FOMC probably voted no policy
  change today it may have decided to apply slight upward rate
  pressure later if the dollar weakens inflation pressures heat
  up or the economy shows sign of strong recovery
      The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to
  tighten policy when they did todays coupon pass said Joseph
  Liro of SG Warburg and Co
      In a move that came a day earlier than most expected the
  Fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by
  offering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds for
  its own account This seasonal reserve add is called a pass
      The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policy
  change said Elizabeth Reiners economist at Dean Witter
  Reynolds Inc 
      She said the spread between banks cost of funds and the
  prime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153
  basis point average in 1986 Reiners said the spread is not
  really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate
  increase
      The Dean Witter economist said that todays prime rate rise
  may have been less a response to interest rates than an
  attempt to enhance the balance sheet bottom line
      Reiners said that given recent problems with loans to
  developing countries large money center banks with heavy
  exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in
  an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans
      The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money
  to one another could help determine how many banks match the
  higher prime rate and also how quickly they move
      In raising their prime rates banks cited a higher cost of
  funds In the three business days through Monday the Federal
  funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly
  614 pct But quarter end pressures helped push up funds  
      The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today reflecting
  demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the
  close of the Japanese fiscal year Funds traded between five
  and 634 pct
      Once the special distortions end analysts said the funds
  rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the
  618 pct area They said that if it stabilizes near there
  banks may not quickly boost their prime rates
      But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many
  that the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to
  help the dollar Then banks would lift prime rates quickly
