BAT SHARES UNDERVALUED SAY STOCK MARKET ANALYSTS
  BAT Industries Plc ltBTIL 1986 results
  which were at the upper end of market expectations showed the
  company was in a strong position and that its shares were
  probably undervalued share analysts said
      BAT shares were down at 524p in late afternoon trading
  after a previous 535p close They touched a high of 538p
  earlier on news of a 19 pct rise in annual profits to 139
  billion pretax
      Stock market analysts said todays generally weak stock
  market plus unwinding of positions after heavy buying of BAT
  shares in the runup to the results caused the fall in the
  share price
      In the current market people almost expect companies to
  beat expectations said one analyst adding that pretax profits
  of 135 to 140 billion stg had been forecast
      BATs 1986 figure of 139 billion stg compared with a 1985
  pretax profit of 117 billion
      Brokers noted that BATs shift away from its
  underperforming industries and the decreasing share of the
  tobacco portion of the group were seen as good signs
      BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy told a news conference that the
  tobacco sector of the company had declined to 50 pct from 74
  pct four years ago
      Sheehy said he could see the tobacco portion of the company
  declining further as other sectors increased in importance
      He said BAT was looking to expand in the area of financial
  services in particular in the US
      Sheehy also said the group had no sizeable acquisitions in
  sight in the near future
      Analysts said BATs increasingly good performance in the
  UK Insurance area was encouraging
      Its declining debttoequity ratio of currently about 16
  pct also made it likely that BAT would soon be looking to make
  major acquisitions they said
