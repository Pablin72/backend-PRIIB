ANALYSTS SAY UK BUDGET POINTS TO BASE RATE CUTS
  Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
  Lawsons Budget speech was described as sound and well balanced
  by analysts if slightly lacking in excitement
      A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected
  tomorrow with most forecasts predicting a halfpoint fall A
  followup halfpoint cut is anticipated next week
      Worthy but boring would probably sum it up Peter Fellner
  UK Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co said It was
  a very very prudent fiscal budget
      Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a
  wellbalanced budget within the confines of the governments
  philosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat
      Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal
  side but offered nothing new on monetary policy
      As was widely expected Lawson split his fiscal adjustment
  between trimming the 198788 PSBR target to 40 billion stg
  from 71 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to
  27 pct
      The target for the narrow measure of money supply M0 was
  kept unchangd at two to six pct while the target for the broad
  Sterling M3 aggregate was dropped
      Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for
  a halfpoint fall in UK Base rates tomorrow but the
  authorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately
  Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full
  onepoint cut tomorrow
      The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which
  it will have to reverse later Jeffrey said though he added a
  further halfpoint cut was quite possible in the near future
      The main worry from todays speech is the outlook for
  inflation given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained
  in it Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said
      Holt noted the rather loose inflation forecast of 40 pct
  at end1987 and said the lower interest rates likely to result
  from the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern
      A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term
  he said although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of
  falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on
  inflation
      The Budget will inspire a lot of shortterm confidence but
  it was not a good budget for inflation he said
      Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about
  the dangers of excessive liquidity buildup but overall was not
  too concerned about a revival of inflation
      Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the
  leading edge of monetary policy but said the authorities were
  likely to be extremely cautious on this front
      He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest
  rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any
  signs of excessive weakness
      Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility
  of the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts
      Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from
  15 to 25 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets
  which are already discounting that amount Jeffrey said
  that the 40 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by
  the favourable outturn for 198687 which is now also forecast
  to be 40 billion stg
      But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any
  clearcut indication about the timing of the general election
  which has to be held before June 1988
      Some believe it signals a poll this June noting that the
  benefits such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise
  duties on alcohol and tobacco become available immediately
      But others said it kept several options open and it was not
  possible to deduce too much from it
      James Capels Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent
  Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in
  that there would be no chickens coming home to roost
      Richard Jeffrey who favours the likelihood of a June
  election said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for
  a Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory
      Nevertheless he said it was likely to result in a boost
  to the Conservative Partys preelection popularity
