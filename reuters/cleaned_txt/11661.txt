GAF ltGAF PLANS NO CHANGES IF OFFER ACCEPTED
  GAF Corp chairman Samuel Heyman told
  Reuters he did not foresee major changes in BorgWarner ltBOR
  if GAFs 46 dlrpershare offer to acquire BorgWarner is
  successful
      We have great respect for BorgWarner mangagement Heyman
  said following a speech at the American Institute of Chemical
  Engineers annual meeting We dont have any particular changes
  in mind
      Earlier today GAF announced that a 316billiondlroffer
  was presented to the board of directors of the Chicagobased
  company
      Last week GAF had purchased additional shares of the
  company for 4018 dlrs increasing its stake in BorgWarner to
  199 pct
      In 1985 GAF made an unsuccessful effort to acquire Union
  Carbide Corp for five billion dlrs and has since expressed an
  interest in acquiring a chemical company that would complement
  its own chemical business
      When asked whether GAF would consider selling the
  nonchemical assets of BorgWarner if its takeover offer is
  accepted Heyman declined to comment
      He also refused to say whether GAF would consider
  increasing its the dollar value of its takeover offer if the
  initial proposal is rejected
      Heyman emphasized that he considered the GAF offer to
  BorgWarner to be a friendly one
      We think we made a fair offer that is good for BorgWarner
  management and good for its shareholders Heyman said
       In his speech Heyman said he feared too many chemical
  companies were attempting to specialize in the same high margin
  niche products
      He said they were turning their backs on core commodity
  chemical businesses 
      Heyman said the chemical industry has taken a total of
  seven billion dlrs in pretax writeoffs during the past two
  years to trim balance sheets
      He predicted that the US chemical industry which
  reported a total of 13 billion dlrs in 1986 profits would see
  a 20 pct gain in earnings this year because of increasing
  exports cheaper feedstock costs and the weakened US dlr
