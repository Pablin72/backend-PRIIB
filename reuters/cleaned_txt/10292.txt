BHP SEES STRONG FOURTH QUARTER BUT LOWER YEAR NET
  The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd ltBRKNS
  said it expects a strong full year result helped by sigificant
  investment allowance credits in the fourth quarter but net
  will fall short of the record 9882 mln dlrs earned in 198586
  ended May 31
      The group earlier reported its net earnings dropped to
  6030 mln dlrs in the first three quarters ended February 28
  from 8130 mln a year earlier
      Third quarter net fell to 2060 mln dlrs from 2386 mln a
  year earlier and 2203 mln in the second quarter ended November
  31 BHP said in a statement
      Earnings in the first nine months were at the lower end of
  share analysts forecasts yesterday of a range of 600 mln to
  620 mln dlrs
      BHP held its annual dividend unchanged at 375 cents after
  declaring a steady final dividend of 20 cents and announced a
  oneforfive bonus issue to shareholders registered May 1
      The bonus is being made from reserves which will not
  qualify for taxfree distribution after the introduction of
  dividend imputation next July 1
      The bonus shares will not rank for the final dividend BHP
  said
      BHP said it should not be expected that the present rate of
  dividend will be maintained on the increased capital
      The level of future dividends will be influenced by the
  implications of the proposed dividend imputation legislation
  it said
      As previously reported dividends will become taxfree in
  shareholders hands provided they are paid out of profits that
  have borne the full 49 pct company tax rate
      BHP which confined comment to the third quarter said
  petroleum net earnings dropped to 988 mln dlrs from 1396 mln
  a year earlier and steel profit to 270 mln from 488 mln
      BHP said the petroleum division earnings fall reflected
  generally lower oil prices and sales volumes from Bass Strait
  while the steel decline was due to a five pct fall in domestic
  sales and higher costs associated with the commissioning of new
  plant and some operational difficulties
      The rise in third quarter minerals net to 957 mln dlrs
  from 815 mln a year earlier largely reflected the increase in
  ownership of the Mt Newman iron ore project it said
      The 607 mln dlr extraordinary gain all in the third term
  reflected a 2407 mln profit on the sale of ltBlue Circle
  Southern Cement Ltd offset by a US Oil acreage writedown
