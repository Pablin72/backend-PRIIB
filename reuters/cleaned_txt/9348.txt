IRAN SAYS HAS BETTER WEAPONS THAN SILKWORM
  Iranian Prime Minister MirHossein
  Mousavi said Iran had more effective missiles at its disposal
  than the shoretosea missiles which had provoked US Concern
  Tehran Radio reported
      A US State Department spokesman said last week Iran had
  acquired Chinesemade Silkworm missiles which posed a greater
  threat to shipping in the Gulf than the weapons previously
  used
      Tehran Radio monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp
  quoted Mousavi as saying that Tehran officially announced after
  its forces overran southern Iraqs Faw peninsula in February
  last year that it had shoretosea missiles
      The fact that the Americans after so much delay are now
  thinking of expressing their concern with panic is because
  Reagan needs this sensation now said Mousavi speaking after a
  cabinet meeting in Tehran
      We also announce today that these missiles are not the
  limit of our war capabilities in the Gulf he added
      Mousavi said the security of the Gulf region had nothing to
  do with the US But Iran would resort to any action to defend
  the Gulf even those actions which are not thought probable by
  Westerners
