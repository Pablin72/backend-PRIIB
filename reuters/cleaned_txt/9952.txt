NORCEN SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987 EARNINGS
  ltNorcen Energy Resources Ltd
  41 pct owned by ltHees International Corp said earnings and
  cash flow will improve in 1987 even if oil and gas prices
  remain at 1986 levels
      The improvement will result from production increases
  lower taxes and royalties reduced financing costs and from
  operating efficiencies and downsizing put into place during
  1986 the company said in the annual report
      Norcen previously reported 1986 earnings excluding a 201
  mln dlr writeoff declined by 58 pct to 500 mln dlrs from
  1197 mln dlrs in in 1985
      Norcens 1986 cash flow fell 10 pct to 2049 mln dlrs from
  2289 mln dlrs in the prior year
      It said the sharp decline in oil prices during 1986 was the
  most significant factor for Norcens reduced performance
      While financial results are far from the previous years
  record levels it is clear that Norcen has withstood declining
  prices and remains financially and operationally strong Norcen
  said It did not give a specific 1987 profit forecast
      The company said it is well positioned to capitalize on
  profitable opportunities in its core business areas and will
  continue to invest to increase revenue and asset values
