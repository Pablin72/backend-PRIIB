GLICKMAN PUSHES HARD FOR 092 FARM PLAN
  Implementation of a oneyear 092
  pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted
  today by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee
  as a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers
  another option when making their planting decisions
      We have a budget driven farm policy It may be a shame
  but we are locked into this said Dan Glickman DKans
  chairman of the subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feed
  grains We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the
  farmer A 092 plan if properly done could do both
      Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 092 bill
  for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains An aide to Glickman
  said that it will probably be introduced next week
      Glickman said a 092 program which allows a farmer to
  forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency
  payment would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill 
  only an extension of the 5092 option already provided under
  the current bill
      It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill
  he said but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet
  budget goals a voluntary 092 plan would be better than
  sharply cutting target prices as USDA has proposed
      A 092 plan however would not be decoupling but simply a
  different type of acreage diversion program Glickman said
      Decoupling  delinking planting decisions from government
  payments  is too much of a policy change to approve at this
  point he said
      I dont think there is any interest in pursuing a
  decoupling bill this year Period Unequivocal Glickman said
  at the hearing
      Sen Rudy Boschwitz RMinn cosponsor of the
  BorenBoschwitz decoupling plan said he supports a short term
  092 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan
      Boschwitz plans to introduce a 092 plan in the senate His
  plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to
  participating farmers require that idled acreage be put to
  conservation use only prohibit haying and grazing on extra
  idled acreage limit participation to a certain number of acres
  in a county and provide tenant protection provisions
      I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987 but
  we can at least move in that direction Boschwitz said
      Robbin Johnson vice president of Cargill Inc testified
  in favor of decoupling Decoupling would end the current bias
  in US farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers
  dependency on the government he said
      A 092 plan does not go far enough in decoupling Johnson
  said and would still encourage farmers to plant
      Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and
  the National Cattlemens Association said their groups oppose
  any 092 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the
  farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers
      But when asked if his association were forced to choose
  between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 092 program Larry
  Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 092
  rather than take sharp cuts in target levels
