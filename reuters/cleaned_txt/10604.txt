US REAL EARNINGS ROSE 06 PCT IN FEBRUARY
  The average weekly earnings of US
  workers after adjustment for inflation and seasonal changes
  rose 06 pct in February after being unchanged in January the
  Labor department said
      The department had earlier reported that real earnings fell
  03 pct in January but revised the figure to show earnings
  unchanged
      Between February this year and February 1986 real
  earnings rose 05 pct the department said
      The rise in February real earnings resulted from a 05 pct
  increase in average hourly earnings and a 06 pct increase in
  average weekly hours That was partly offset by a 04 pct rise
  in the consumer price index which measures inflation the
  department said
      Before seasonal adjustment weekly earnings last month
  averaged 30759 dlrs up from 30513 dlrs in January and up
  from 30066 dlrs in February 1986
