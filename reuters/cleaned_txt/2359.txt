AUSTRALIA ATTACKS US GATT FARM RULES EXEMPTION
  Australia accused the US of increasing
  protectionism on agricultural products and called for an end to
  Washingtons special 32year exemption from certain GATT rules
  on agricultural trade
      Robert Arnott Australias delegate to the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT made the appeal at a
  special annual meeting which reviews the 1955 US waiver
      Australia today said the United States goals of reducing
  US barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted by
  actions which in fact increased protection in trade in
  agriculture the Australian delegation said in a statement
      The United States section 22 waiver is one of the basic
  flaws in the GATT coverage of agriculture Arnott told the
  meeting
      Arnott said the waiver had continually been used as a
  justification for dubious protective measures by the US He
  listed a recent Dairy Export Incentive Program and steps to
  close the US sugar market to imports
      He also told Reuters the waiver allowed Washington to
  impose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domestic
  support programs This covered imports of dairy products
  peanuts cotton and sugar
      Asked to comment Michael Samuels US ambassador to the
  GATT told Reuters These charges have been made since the very
  beginning The waiver is part of domestic US agricultural
  policy part of our law when we joined the GATT
      We have agreed to put the waiver on the table during the
  Uruguay Round and invite other countries to do the same with
  their programs We can negotiate them all Samuels added
      Ninetytwo nations are taking part in the fouryear Uruguay
  round of talks launched in Punta del Este last September
  Bargaining in agricultural goods and services banking
  tourism insurance is included for the first time as well as
  manufactured goods
