US HEATING OIL FUTURES UP SHARPLY IN APRIL
  A supply shortage of number two oil in
  New York for prompt delivery boosted the April heating oil
  contract on US energy futures traders said
      Crude oil futures followed but gasoline futures lagged
  April heating oil ended 124 cts higher to 5165 cts a gallon
  while April crude settled 28 cts higher at 1864 dlrs
      The rally was led by spot month heating oil contract
  which seemed to move higher because of tigtened prompt
  deliveries in New York Harbor said James Ritterbusch vice
  president at Paine Webber Inc in Chicago
      April gasoline was 028 cent higher at 5315 cts a gallon
      Ritterbusch said the market also found support from a
  report in the Middle East Economics Survey that said that OPEC
  oil output was down to about 14 mln barrels per day in the
  second week of March
      There was not a lot of interest to sell the market because
  of belief in OPEC said Richard Redoglia a broker with
  Merrill Lynch Futures Inc
      Redoglia and Ritterbusch said April heating oil could
  continue to rally above 53 cts a gallon while crude futures
  could test 19 dlrs a barrel before profittaking stunts the
  move higher
