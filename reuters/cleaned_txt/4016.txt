USX ltX PROVED OIL GAS RESERVES FALL IN 1986
  USX Corp said proved reserves of oil
  and natural gas liquids fell 28 pct to 8028 mln barrels at the
  end of 1986 from 112 billion barrels at yearend 1985
      The figures in USXs justreleased 1986 annual report
  indicate much of the drop resulted from the exclusion of 2937
  mln barrels of Libyan reserves after the US government last
  June directed US oil companies to end Libyan operations
      USX which owns Marathon Oil Co and Texas Oil and Gas Corp
  had 60 pct of its 1986 sales of 1494 billion dlrs from its oil
  and gas operations
      About 24 pct of total sales came from USXs USS steel unit
  and 16 pct from diversified businesses which include oilfield
  services raw materials minerals chemicals and real estate
      According to the report domestic liquids reserves fell
  slightly to 6285 mln barrels from 6289 mln and foreign
  reserves fell to 1743 mln from 4864 mln barrels The large
  drop in foreign reserves was in the Middle East and Africa
  where they fell to about 93 mln barrels from 3167 mln
  reflecting the exclusion of Libya
      Total natural gas reserves fell to 482 trillion cubic feet
  at yearend 1986 from 518 trillion at the end of 1985
      Again most of the drop came from the Middle East and
  Africa where reserves fell to zero from 719 billion cubic
  feet excluding Libyan reserves
      US natural gas reserves fell to 344 trillion cubic feet
  from 365 trillion and foreign reserves fell to 138 trillion
  from 153 trillion
      In other areas USX said total capital spending fell to 962
  mln dlrs in 1986 from 178 billion dlrs in 1985 The 1986
  audited figure is eight mln dlrs higher than the unaudited
  figure the company reported on Jan 27
      USX also said it expects to record a gain of 150 mln dlrs
  in 1988 representing 50 pct of previously existing investment
  tax credits allowable under the new tax law The loss of the
  other half of the credits was reflected in the fourth quarter
      In a discussion of steel results USX said plants that were
  shut down last month and some previously idled plants may be
  permanently closed USX took a fourth quarter charge of 103
  billion dlrs to restructure its steel operations The charge
  included the indefinite idling last month of four plants in
  Utah Pennsylvania and Texas
      Other plants or parts of plants in Pennsylvania Indiana
  Alabama Ohio and Chicago had been previously idled
      These operations are not permanently shut down Improved
  market conditions for the products from these plants may make
  it feasible to reopen some of them USX said in the report
      On the other hand a lack of any future market improvement
  may necessitate their permanent closing it added
