OIL TAX BREAK RIDICULED BY US HOUSE TAXWRITER
  A House taxwriter said Energy
  Secretary James Herringtons outrageous plan to restore an old
  tax break for oil companies was both bad tax and energy policy
      Rep Pete Stark a California Democrat and senior House
  Ways and Means Committee member said Herringtons plan for a
  275 pct depletion allowancewhich in effect is a special 275
  pct tax deduction would cost seven billion dlrs a year
      He must have missed the last two years of federal tax
  reform by sleeping as soundly as Rip Van Winkle Stark said
      He said in a statement the oil industry already pays an
  effective lower rate of US tax on investment 15 pct versus
  aggregate corporate tax on all investment of 34 pct according
  to a recent Congressional Research Service study
