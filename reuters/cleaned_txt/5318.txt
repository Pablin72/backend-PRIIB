ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT FRANCE AWAITS ECONOMIC LIFT
  A year after squeezing to power with a
  narrow bare coalition majority Gaullist Prime minister Jacques
  Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations
  choking the French economy
      But France is still waiting for a promised industrial
  recovery the government says will follow from its free market
  policies Company profits and the stock market are rising But
  so is unemployment Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year
  and the outlook for inflation held to a 20year low of 21 pct
  in 1986 is uncertain
      Forced last month to cut the governments 1987 growth
  target and raise its inflation estimate Finance Minister
  Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy But
  some government supporters say they fear time for an economic
  miracle may be running out
      The political clock is ticking towards Presidential
  elections due by April next year
      Frances economic performance led by a mixed cast of
  rightwing ministers and a socialist President has won mixed
  reviews from nonpartisan analysts
      For Michel Develle Director of Economic Studies at
  newlyprivatised Banque Paribas the governments outstanding
  achievement has been to launch a veritable intellectual
  revolution breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of
  state control
      The figures may look mediocre  neither good nor bad 
  but set in their context of structural reforms they are
  excellent Develle said
      But some analysts say they fear that Balladur chief
  architect of the governments free market policies may be
  pursuing a mirage
      The belief that economic liberalism will produce an
  explosion of economic forces is ideological said Indosuez chief
  economist Jean Cheval Personally I think its an illusion
  Dirigisme direction is a basic fact of the French system
  from school onwards Ultraliberalism is impossible
      Illusion or not the government has pushed its vision hard
  Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls
  have been largely abolished labour regulations have been
  pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely
  popular programme has been launched to sell stateowned banks
  and industries to private investors
      Since December nearly five mln French investors have
  bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas ltPARIPA and glass
  maker Cie de SaintGobain SA ltSGEPPA the first two state
  companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion
  franc fiveyear privatisation plan
      Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of
  capital and the lifting of most currency controls money has
  flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad helping to lift
  the market 57 pct last year and another 125 pct since
  December
      At the end of last year the government abolished price
  controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car
  repairs and hairdressing freeing from state intervention small
  businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy
      The immediate result was a 09 pct rise in consumer prices
  in January partly responsible for a forced revision in the
  official 1987 inflation forecast to 25 pct from two pct or
  less
      But even 25 pct would be a fantastic result when you
  consider that prices are now free for the first time since
  1945 commented Develle of Paribas
      Other achievements include a major reduction in the states
  foreign debts and a cut in the state budget deficit to 1411
  billion francs last year 25 billion francs below target and
  down from 1533 billion in 1985
      But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a
  gradual improvement in industrial productivity the French
  franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating
  three pct devaluation against the West German mark its second
  since Chirac took power
      A recent report by the Organisation for Economic
  Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for
  failing to produce the goods that its potential customers
  wanted
      Outside the mainly statecontrolled high technology
  sectors French industrial goods were increasingly illadapted
  to demand and overpriced the report said
      French economists including Cheval at Indosuez agreed
  with the report One of the assumptions of the government is
  that if you give them freedom the employers will invest and
  moderniseBut nine out of ten will say yes they like
  freedom and then wait to be told which way to go he said
      And despite rising industrial investment and the
  introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment
  the end1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 27
  million some 300000 more than a year earlier
      The problem for the government is that there may be little
  more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth
      French producers failed more than most to take advantage of
  last years oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the
  shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like
  West Germany and Japan they say
