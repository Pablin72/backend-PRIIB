BELGIAN BANK SAID TO SEE SLOWER GROWTH
  An internal report produced by the
  Belgian National Bank foresees the countrys gross national
  product growth falling in 1987 to 10 pct from 23 pct in 1986
  the independent newspaper Le Soir said
      A National Bank spokesman said the newspaper article was
  basically correct but that the report was produced six weeks
  ago and figures were therefore to some extent out of date
      The governments planning bureau predicted growth of 09
  pct this year in a study published last month
