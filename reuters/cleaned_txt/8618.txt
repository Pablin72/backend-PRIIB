  Industrial holding company Williams
  Holdings Plc said it was bidding 5422 mln stg for the ordinary
  shares of building products and packaging group Norcros Plc

  night of 397p
      A statement by Williams said it was confident of the merits
  of the proposed merger and it had therefore taken care to
  propose from the outset the right terms including a full cash
  alternative
      The offer will include a partial convertible alternative
  under which shareholders would receive up to a total of 20569
  mln new second convertible shares in Williams instead of their
  ordinary share allocations
      The offer for Norcros preferential shares offers one
  Williams preferential share for each one of Norcros for a
  value of 130p each and a total of 29 mln stg
      Last week Williams reported that pretax profits for 1986
  rose to 229 mln stg from 63 mln
      Speculation about a bid for Norcros had been circulating in
  the market for several months dealers said Initially it
  centred on ltBunzl Plc which once held a 26 pct stake then
  switched to Williams when it began accumulating shares
      Earlier this year Williams suggested holding talks with
  Norcros on a possible merger but was rebuffed by Norcros which
  replied that any benefits that could be achieved could also
  result from normal trading
      In the six months to endSeptember Norcros reported a rise
  in pretax profits to 2014 mln stg from 1855 mln on turnover
  that lifted to 31182 mln from 30391 mln
      Williams Holdings began expanding from 1982 when it had a
  market capitalisation of around one mln stg A series of
  acquisitions in the next four years has pushed its
  capitalisation up to around 380 mln
      The convertible offer would be on the basis of four
  Williams convertibles for every Norcros share worth 428p a
  share The cash alternative would offer the equivalent of
  4002p a share
      The announcement of the bid pushed Williams share price
  down to 733p from last nights close at 750p
      Williams said it held a total 850000 shares in Norcros or
  07 pct while an associate held a further 199 mln or 16 pct
