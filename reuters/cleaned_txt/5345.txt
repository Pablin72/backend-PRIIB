  With the April 15 tax return deadline
  less than a month away confused taxpayers will be converging
  on H and R Block Incs offices to interpret the new tax codes
      Financial results for the nations largest tax preparer are
  expected to be good in fiscal 1987 but next year could be a
  bonanza analysts say
      For the short term the key word is confusion Block Vice
  President Tom Bloch said in an interview When Congress
  drastically changes laws confusion results and tax preparers
  benefit Bloch said
      Next year when taxpayers take the new forms and place
  them side by side to compare them more people will throw their
  hands up and say Im going to get help he said
  Tax forms will look very different next year he added
      Kidder Peabody analyst Herbert Buchbinder expects Blocks
  fiscal 1987 year to end April 30 to show good gains over
  fiscal 1986 earnings of 601 mln dlrs or 241 dlrs a share on
  revenues of 6067 mln dlrs He estimates Blocks fiscal 1987
  earnings at 275 to 280 dlrs
      Next year Block could have a bonanza Buchbinder said
  Based on estimates of a larger work force Block could show a
  gain of more than five pct in tax forms prepared he said In
  the 1986 tax season Block prepared 9215300 US tax returns
  up 15 pct over the previous year
      The Internal Revenue Service estimates about 100 mln
  individual income tax returns will be filed for the 1987 tax
  season up from last years 94 mln forms Professional tax
  preparers accounted for just over 43 million forms according
  to the IRS
      For the longer term while confusion will continue to bring
  clients into Blocks 8866 tax preparation offices worldwide
  there are some changes in the act that will have a negative
  effect Bloch conceded
      Certain changes in filing requirements will shorten the tax
  return and in some cases simplify the form he noted In
  addition some low income wage earners will be taken off the
  tax rolls he said
      Block is currently analyzing its price structure to try to
  offset some of the negatives Last tax season the average cost
  for each return in the US amounted to 4805 dlrs and 4573
  dlrs worldwide Bloch said This tax season rates will be up
  about three or four pct in line with the inflation rate he
  said
      Block expects some expansion this tax season of its
  electronic filing system which directly feeds into the IRS and
  can speed up the refund process Block can choose where and by
  how much it wants to expand into the seven cities made
  available for the direct filing by the IRS Bloch noted
      The IRS estimates about 90000 returns will be directly
  filed this tax season up from the 26000 returns injected in
  the 1986 tax season
      First Kansas City analyst Jonathan Braatz said that Block
  will benefit greatly from lower tax rates in fiscal 1988
      Braatz expects Blocks advertising budget to be about the
  same as last year which will be helped a bit by lower costs for
  television ads They may get a little more bang for their
  buck he said
      He estimates Block has about 150 mln dlrs cash on its
  balance sheet sheet and says if interest rates rise it could
  be of great benefit to them
