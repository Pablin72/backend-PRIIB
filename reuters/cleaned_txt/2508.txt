HOUSE 092 PLAN SEEN SCALEDBACK TO 1987 WHEAT
  Key members of the House Agriculture
  committee have agreed to scaleback the 092 provision of a
  pending disaster aid bill to cover only 1987 crop wheat but a
  broader 092 proposal is likely to be resurrected later
  Congressional sources said
      The sources said key lawmakers including Reps Glenn
  English DOkla and Dan Glickman DKan agreed to support
  an amendment to be offered next week by Rep Charles Stenholm
  DTex which would limit 092 only to producers of 1987 crop
  winter and spring wheat
      This would scaleback the 092 provision to the original
  proposal by English allowing a pilot 092 program for 1987
  wheat only That provision was later broadened by the
  subcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat
      Under 092 a farmer can forego planting a crop but still
  collect 92 pct of deficiency payments
      Earlier today the House Agriculture committee postponed
  until next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid bill
  and 092
      The agreement to limit 092 to a wheat pilot program
  follows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influential
  farm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 092
  and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill
      Congressional sources said there has not been enough time
  to study the implications of a broad 092
      The timing of the proposal is off said one aide to a
  House Agriculture committee member
      However several Congressional sources said they expect a
  broader 092 provision to emerge again when the House
  Agriculture committee is faced next month with the need to make
  spending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as part
  of an overall deficit reduction package
      Gene Moos aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley
  DWash predicted agricultures share of budget cuts may
  exceed one billion dlrs
      A broader 092 might be resurrected later because both the
  Congressional Budget Office and the Reagan administration
  estimate it would result in significant budget savings
      A US Agriculture Department official said 092 for all
  1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 15
  billion dlrs over five years
      Another factor which could affect the 092 debate is the
  approach of planting season Congressional sources said
      Some officials said it already is late for implementation
  of a 092 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 for
  wheat and feedgrains
      If Congress approved 092 later in the year signup either
  would have to be extended or reopened sources said
