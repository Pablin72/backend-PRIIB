MARKET WELCOMES LOWER AUSTRALIAN PAYMENTS DEFICIT
  The Australian dollar rose more than 40
  points and money market interest rates retreated on the better
  than expected improvement in the February current account
  deficit but economists and dealers were cautious about
  identifying it as the start of a downward trend
      The current account deficit narrowed to 750 mln dlrs in
  February from 123 billion in January It hit 1382 billion
  dlrs in 198586 to endJune
      The currency jumped to 0685863 US Dlrs and traded as
  high as 06875 before retreating to around 0686469
      Its got 69 cents written all over it one dealer said
      Foreign exchange dealers said some buyers had gone long on
  the dollar expecting a lower figure and sold it down about 30
  points to 06820 US Dlrs before the release
      The 750 mln dlr deficit was at the lower end of forecasts
  and analysts said the market would welcome any figure below one
  billion dlrs for March
      Banque National de Paris ltBNPPA senior dealer Peter
  Nicolls cautioned that in the long term the currency and
  interest rates were too high for import substitution and export
  industries
      Nicolls said he expected the dollar to go as high as 06875
  and perhaps to 69 cents tomorrow
      ltLloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose said
  the 42 mln dlr trade surplus was encouraging as were imports at
  277 billion dlrs down from 299 billion in January
      But he warned that the outlook for rural and iron and coal
  exports remained poor We should remember we are paying
  something like seven to eight billion dollars simply to service
  our foreign debt and that is not going to go away in the near
  term Buttrose said
      Buttrose said he expected a March deficit of around 900 mln
  dlrs and added Any figure under a billion dollars will be
  acceptable to the markets
      ANZ Banking Group Ltd ltANZAS senior economist Ian Little
  said the big question was whether the improvement in exports
  could be sustained February FOB exports rose to 282 billion
  dlrs from a revised 274 billion in January
      Interest rates responded quickly to the deficit news with
  90day bank bill yields falling to 16421645 pct from early
  highs of 1650 and yields yesterday as high as 1665
      Longer term yields fell with 10year bonds at 136668 pct
  from 1374 before the release and highs of 1387 yesterday
      The stock market was easier at midsession but brokers said
  the current account data had little impact on trading
