ITALIAN 1986 GDP UP 27 PCT UNEMPLOYMENT RISES
  Extracts from a report by Italys Budget
  Ministry on the countrys economic development in 1986 showed
  gross domestic product GDP 27 pct higher in real terms than
  in 1985 but a rise in unemployment
      GDP calculated at 1980 prices rose to 434682 billion lire
  last year from 423064 billion in 1985 On a current prices
  basis GDP was up 11 pct totalling 894362 billion lire in
  1986 against 805754 billion in 1985
       But growth was insufficient to prevent a rise in
  unemployment to 111 pct last year from 103 pct in 1985 the
  ministry said
      The report said falling oil prices and the depreciation of
  the dollar during 1986 had favoured oilimporting countries
  such as Italy
      These factors helped Italy cut inflation to an average 63
  pct in 1986 down from 93 pct in 1985
      They also helped a major improvement in the trade balance
      On the basis of data recently recalculated by the national
  statistics institute Istat Italy had a trade deficit in 1986
  of 3722 billion lire the report said This slightly revises a
  previous deficit figure of 3717 billion issued by Istat and
  compares with a negative balance of 23085 billion for 1985
