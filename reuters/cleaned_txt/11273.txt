ALUMINIUM CAPACITY GROWTH TREND SEEN INSUFFICIENT
  Aluminium capacity expansion planned for
  the period after 1990 will be insufficient to supply any
  acceleration in demand growth let alone an increase on the
  scale which seems likely according to analyst Anthony Bird
  Associates 1987 Aluminium Review
      By 1995 nonsocialist world primary capacity will need to
  be around 18 mln tonnes whereas on current plans only 15 mln
  tonnes are scheduled Bird said
      Bird forecast higher economic growth after 1990 and
  increased imports by less developed countries
      Aluminium consumption growth is not expected to accelerate
  by as much as general growth but nonsocialist world
  consumption is nevertheless forecast to increase sharply from
  1377 mln tonnes in 1990 to 1725 mln tonnes in 1995 Bird
  said
      Aluminium companies were slow to adjust to the pace of
  change after 1973 the review said and now they have completed
  this transition they may be in danger of remaining preoccupied
  with the strategies of retrenchment and survival which have
  served them well in recent years
      In order to encourage the construction of additional
  smelters aluminium prices will need to settle at a higher
  level
      Production costs are likely to rise again in the years
  ahead as the glut of alumina capacity vanishes and electricity
  suppliers take a more aggressive line with aluminium companies
  according to the review
      At March 1987 prices the three most likely costprice
  scenarios call for a longrun aluminium price of between 73 and
  895 cents a lb depending on exchange rates Bird said
      Such a price development is not expected to cause any
  marked competitive problems for the metal because of the likely
  rise in commodity prices as a whole and cost pressures in the
  pipeline for steel and copper
      In the short term however the outlook is dull Bird said
  as the world economy has not responded well to the
  opportunities offered by cheap oil
      Its 1987 consumption forecast of 1301 mln tonnes is 04
  pct down on 1986 while production is forecast six pct higher
  in 1987 at 1267 mln tonnes
