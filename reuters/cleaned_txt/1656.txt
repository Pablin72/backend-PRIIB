S KOREAN TRADE SURPLUS WITH US SEEN FALLING
  South Koreas record 71 billion dlrs
  trade surplus with the US is bound to diminish as the
  country switches purchases from Japan in favor of US
  companies Trade Minister WoongBae Rha said
       He rejected suggestions the Korean Won is undervalued and
  denied any plans for a drastic and sudden revaluation
      Rha is heading a trade mission to 37 US cities Last year
  South Korea ran a 43 billion dlr trade surplus including a
  record 71 billion surplus with the US and a 55 billion dlr
  deficit with Japan
      Rha told Reuters in an interview the current trade mission
  is looking for 20 billion dlrs in purchases from US
  companies about a quarter of which represents transferred
  purchases from Japanese sources
      Rha said the items being sought by the current mission are
  mainly chemicals machinery and parts
      He said South Korea is the fourth largest importer of US
  agricultural products The current mission is not involved in
  that area but there are plans to buy substantial amounts of
  cotton from the US
      He noted his country is clearly not as open as the American
  market Nor is it reasonable to expect that it should be
  considering South Korea has a 40 billion dlr foreign debt and
  spends six pct of its gross national product on defense
