  Japanese importers bought some 95000
  tonnes of Chinese soybeans late last month for May to September
  shipment under the semiannual trade accords trade sources
  said
      The FOB premium rose to 1350 dlrs per tonne up 250 dlrs
  from the premium for the November to April shipment but down
  from 1380 for the last May to September shipment
      Flat prices for Chinese beans are based on futures prices
  in Chicago plus the FOB premium
      Japanese purchases of Chinese soybeans including spot
  buying may have totalled 240000 to 250000 tonnes of the 1986
  crop for November to April 1987 shipment down from some
  300000 tonnes the previous year the sources said
      Domestic demand for edibleuse soybeans is expected to
  remain stable at about 240000 to 250000 tonnes a year the
  sources said
      In recent years Japanese importers have overbought Chinese
  edibleuse soybeans and sold the surplus to domestic crushers
  but low 1986 US Crop prices have discouraged the purchase of
  Chinese origin beans for crushing they said
