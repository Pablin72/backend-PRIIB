RAFIDAIN BANKS JORDAN BRANCH RAISES CAPITAL
  The Jordan branch of Iraqs Rafidain Bank
  said it will raise paidup capital to comply with the countrys
  minimum requirement of five mln dinars by drawing on profits
  from its operations in the country
      Jordans government asked banks in early 1985 to comply
  with the new capital requirement  raised from three mln
  dinars  by the start of 1986
      Rafidains Area Manager Adnan Abdul Karim alAzzawi told
  Reuters the branch had now registered its capital at the higher
  level but did not say how long it would take to pay it in The
  banks 1986 balance shows paidup capital of 31 mln dinars
      Banks in Jordan have generally complied with the higher
  capital requirement except Chase Manhattan which decided
  instead to close its operation banking sources said
      Local banks floated shares to raise extra capital while
  the branches of foreign banks brought in additional cash
      Banking sources said it appeared that Jordan had made an
  exception in Rafidains case allowing it longer to comply
  They said the gesture refelcted close political ties between
  Jordan and Iraq as well as Baghdads financial difficulties
      The Jordan branch saw pretax profit rise 80 pct in 1986 to
  550332 dinars on assets of 126 mln dinars
