UK GROWTH RATE SEEN AT THREE PCT THIS YEAR
  Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
  Lawson presenting his budget for fiscal 198788 to parliament
  said UK Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar
  1987
      He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of
  payments deficit in 1987 of 25 billion stg after a 11
  billion shortfall in 1986 Inflation is expected to be 40 pct
  at the end of 1987 he said adding it may exceed 45 pct by
  the summer before falling back to 40 pct by the end of the
  year
      The planned PSBR for 198788 was 40 billion stg unchanged
  when compared with the likely outturn for fiscal 198687
  Lawson said
      Although no explicit target was set for the broad sterling
  M3 money supply Lawson said broad money will continue to be
  taken into account in assessing monetary conditions as well as
  the exchange rate
      The low outturn of the PSBR in 198687 was mainly due to
  the buoyancy of nonoil tax revenues in general and the
  corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business
  sector in particular
      On oil prices Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier
  assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per
  barrel in calendar 1987 The treasury would strive to keep the
  PSBR at 10 pct of GDP in future he said
