PHILIPPINES TO LOBBY US FOR HIGHER SUGAR QUOTA
  The Philippines will ask the US
  Agriculture Department USDA to increase its 1987 sugar import
  quota following market reports that Taiwan will not be able to
  fulfil its quota Sugar Regulation Administration SRA
  chairman Arsenim Yulo said
      Yulo told Reuters the SRA would also protest a USDA move to
  award Taiwans shortfall to the Dominican Republic
      The Dominican Republic already has a larger sugar quota
  Yulo said Any Taiwanese shortfall should be awarded to the
  Philippines or at the least we should share a hike with the
  Dominican Republic
      The USDA last December listed 1987 sugar import quota
  allocations for the Dominican Republic at 160160 short tons
  and for Taiwan at 10920 short tons
      The Philippines has said it was badly hit by a cut in its
  quota to 143780 short tons from 231660 in 1986
