ROCKWELL ltROK SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987
  Rockwell International Corp
  continues to expect significant improvement in 1987 results
  despite the somewhate disappointing performance of one of its
  business segments President Donald Beall told Reuters
      Rockwell reported net earnings in its first quarter ended
  December 31 of 1494 mln dlrs or 105 dlrs per share compared
  to 1258 mln dlrs or 84 cts per share a year ago
      Operating earnings however were off about four pct and
  analysts have attributed the decline to Rockwells
  AllenBradley unit which has suffered from weakness in the
  industrial automation market
      It is in a soft market now but we are not concerned It
  is moving forward with market development and is enhancing
  market share Beall said of AllenBradley unit
      Beall who was in Los Angeles to address a Technology
  management conference said first quarter sales for the
  AllenBradley unit were flat as compared to a year earlier He
  said the company does not break out operating earnings by unit
  on a quarterly basis
      Beall said the recent trend toward cost sharing in the
  research and development phase of government contracts should
  not have a major impact on Rockwells nearterm performance
      He noted however the increasing focus on cost sharing
  could limit technological innovation
      I worry that we are heading into a period of misuse of
  contracting approaches too early in the development stages of
  important military contracts Beall said adding longterm
  we have a very serious problem
      In addition Beall told the conference the greatest
  competitive threat to defense contractors is in defense
  electronics due to the governments attempt to take advantage
  of competitively priced products made outside the US
