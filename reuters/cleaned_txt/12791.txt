STOLTENBERG SAYS PARIS ACCORD POLICY TO CONTINUE
  West German Finance Minister Gerhard
  Stoltenberg said the currency agreement reached in Paris in
  February had been successful and would be continued
      Stoltenberg told journalists before he attends next weeks
  International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington that The 
  Strategy to stabilise currencies around current levels has
  proven its worth and will also determine future developments
      Stoltenberg declined to comment specifically on what he
  would consider to be an undervalued dollar but said a dollar
  around 180 marks created problems for West Germanys exports
      Stoltenberg said studies by international organisations had
  made it clear that especially in the US And in Japan major
  efforts remained necessary to support adjustments in foreign
  trade balances via necessary corrections to economic policy
      Noone would benefit if after years of overvaluation the
  US Dollar fell into the other extreme that is strong
  undervaluation he said
      Stoltenberg said West Germany had a keen interest in a
  swift agreement between the US And Japan concerning the
  current trade dispute over semiconductors
      Asked whether he believed the markets would test the Paris
  currency accord Stoltenberg did not comment specifically but
  noted that much of what had been discussed in Paris had not
  been published
      The Paris declaration did not state the levels at which
  central banks of the major industrialised countries would
  intervene
      Stoltenberg said that everything had been carefully
  considered He said he had nothing further to add
      Stoltenberg also appeared to suggest that West Germany was
  now no longer under any pressure from the US Government to
  stimulate its economy
      He declined to respond specifically to a question on this
  subject but said You must attach particular importance to the
  consensus which was reached in Paris
      The minister nevertheless added that he would make clear
  during his trip to Washington that West Germanys nominal trade
  figures gave a false impression about actual trade flows
      Stoltenberg noted that in 1986 Bonns exports fell by a
  nominal two pct while its nominal imports fell by 107 pct
  West Germanys imports dropped largely because of foreign
  currency developments and the cheaper price of oil and led to a
  record trade surplus last year
      However Stoltenberg said that in real terms West Germanys
  exports by volume had increased by 15 pct while real imports
  had risen by a much stronger 62 pct
      In this way West Germany had made its contribution to
  economic stability Stoltenberg added
      Stoltenberg noted the government expected imports to rise
  by a real four to five pct in 1987 with exports stagnating
      He said it was too early to revise official forecasts for
  West Germanys economic growth this year The government has
  forecast an unchanged 25 pct rise in Gross National Product
      The Kiel Institute a leading research body is still
  expecting growth of three pct but some other research
  institutes have revised forecasts down to below two pct
  Stoltenberg said the wide range of predictions showed how many
  imponderables had to be taken into account and said no drastic
  changes in official forecasts were needed
