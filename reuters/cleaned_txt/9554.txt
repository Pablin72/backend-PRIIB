CANADA MAY MONITOR STEEL SHIPMENTS
  Canada may begin monitoring steel
  flowing in and out of the country to determine if any steel is
  being illegally transshipped to the US senior government
  trade officials said
      The officials asking not to be identified said the
  government will investigate an industry contention that steel 
  imported from countries such as South Korea and Taiwan is being
  diverted to the US and ultimately exasperating concerns about
  the level of Canadian exports south of the border
      But the senior officials asking not to be indentified
  said that despite intense pressure from the Reagan
  Administration Ottawa was not considering any kind of formal
  limits on Canadian shipments to the US
      In a sense what I hope we are doing is buying some time
  said one official who claimed Canadian companies were fair
  traders in the big American market
      If approved by the Canadian cabinet the officials said a 
  monitoring system will be established in the next three or four
  months
      I guess if we find transshipment is a problem we would
  have to do something about it said a trade official
      Canadian steel shipments to the US have risen to 57 pct
  of the US market in recent months almost double the level
  just two years ago
      The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time of
  growing anger in the US over rising steel imports from
  several countries in the face of a decline among domestic steel
  producers
      Some US lawmakers have proposed Canadas share of the
  American market be limited to 24 per cent
      The Ontario Government has urged Ottawa to require foreign
  companies to obtain permits to import steel into the country
  Currently import licences are required only for carbon or raw
  steel which makes up less than half the steel market
      Canada exported two billion Canadian dlrs worth of steel in
  1986 while importing 944mln dlrs worth of the product in the
  same year
