MADAGASCAR COFFEE PRODUCTION SEEN LOWER IN 1987
  Madagascars available coffee
  output is estimated at 80725 tonnes this year down from
  82210 in 1986 due to a rundown of government agricultural
  services and the poor state of feeder roads in rural areas
  Agriculture Ministry sources said
      This is after accounting for the loss of some 15000 to
  20000 tonnes due to the transport problems in the countryside
  they said
      The sources did not give an estimate for exports in 1987
  but they noted that shipments declined to 37200 tonnes last
  year from 41662 in 1985
      Low yields from the countrys ageing coffee plantations and
  prevalence of the fungal disease Hemileia Vastatrix also
  contributed to the poor performance the sources said
      They pointed out that 52 pct of Madagascars coffee bushes
  were planted before 1930
      The sources said Madagascar was still a long way from
  reaching the production target of 110000 tonnes per year and
  the export target of 63000 tonnes outlined in the governments
  19861990 fiveyear plan
      In order to reverse the decline in coffee production the
  government has decided to plant 20000 hectares with
  highyielding arabica and canephora varieties the sources
  said
      The planting programme will begin this year and is aimed at
  producing 300 to 360 kilos per hectare of beans with a low
  caffeine content
      The sources added that Madagascars plan to export roasted
  coffee has failed to take off due to packaging problems Only
  650 tonnes of roasted coffee were exported last year
