EC DRIVING TO CAPTURE BRAZIL WHEAT MARKET  USDA
  The European Community EC sold
  75000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85
  and 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuing
  bid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market the US
  Agriculture Department said
      The sale sharply undercut the US offer of 112 dlrs per
  tonne FOB for 33000 tonnes of wheat it said in its latest
  report on Export Markets for US grains
      EC sales to Brazil total about 225000 tonnes during
  198687 JulyJune in stark contrast to only 50000 tonnes in
  the 198586 season it said
      The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a
  time when the Brazilian Wheat Board BWB expects the wheat
  import market will expand to 34 mln tonnes from the current
  forecast of 30 mln in the 198687 year
      The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in
  domestic production and says government plans to lower the
  guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs
  will contribute to greater import demand the USDA said
      It said the BWB expects the US to be major supplier of
  the additional 400000 tonnes but commitments for purchase of
  US wheat through twothirds of 198687 year total only
  600000 tonnes versus 700000 a year ago
