  see demand over supply as being sustainable for some time

  were up at a time when the companys total 11 mln tonne North
  American smelter system had less than a weeks supply
      Were short and were buying he said

  Aluminum Institute to report a drop in total nonSocialist
  stocks in February and March He estimated supply in the latter
  month will have fallen 100000 to 150000 tonnes based in part
  on current low inventories of aluminium in Japan and on the
