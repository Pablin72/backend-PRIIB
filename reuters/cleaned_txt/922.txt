CRA EXPECTS TO PAY FINAL DIVIDEND OF 10 CENTS
  CRA Ltd ltCRAAS said it expected to
  pay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share
  after July 1 making 13 cents forthe year against 15 in 1985
      The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net
  earnings rose to 1382 mln dlrs from 878 mln in 1985 against
  analysts forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to160 mln
      CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until
  later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation
  to its shareholders After July 1 dividends will be taxfree
  to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the
  full 49 pct company tax rate has been pid
      The company operates on a substituted tax year not the
  fiscal year ending June 30 and as a result has incurred tax at
  the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings CRA said in a statement
      Consequently it has funds available for distribution with
  dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation
  legislation before determining the final payout it said
      Despite the higher net earnings CRA said 1986 was a poor
  year for the minerals industry with the notable exception of
  gold producers
      Prices for major metals expressed in real US Dollars
  declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years it said
      Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility
  and uncertainty while the revaluation of the yen is leading to
  substantial restructuring of Japanese industry CRA said
      World demand for metals is growing slowly Inventories have
  steadily declined with supply and demand in better balance
  but overcapacity continues CRA said
      Turning to contributions to its earnings CRA said
  Bougainville Copper Ltd ltBUVAS contributed 313 mln dlrs
  while its share of Comalco Ltds ltCMACS net was 378 mln
      Net earnings from ironore operations were 1118 mln dlrs
  against 1492 mln in 1985 it said
      Lead zinc and silver mining and smelting operations
  incurred a net loss of 668 mln dlrs against a 381 mln loss in
  1985 CRA said
      Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 367 mln dlrs
  against 341 mln while salt raised its contribution to 47 mln
  from 28 mln
      CRAs share of earnings from the Argyle diamond project
  amounted to 120 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985
      CRA said the main item in its 25028 mln dlr extraordinary
  loss was a 1729 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange
  losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard
      Other extraordinary items were 633 mln dlrs provided for
  closures and writedown of assets and a 141 mln increase in
  future tax provisions CRA said
      Cash flow continued at a high level being 9506 mln dlrs
  before capital expenditure against 102 billion in 1985 The
  strong cash flow coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights
  issue and the use of existing cash balances enabled group debt
  to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs
      CRA said it held forward contracts at yearend to buy 985
  mln US Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt This cost 470
  mln dlrs after tax included in the net interest cost
