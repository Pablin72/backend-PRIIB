STUDY PREDICTS US DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL
  A government study has concluded the
  US Will be dependent on oil from the middle east into the
  next century and must take steps to reduce its vulnerability
  the New York Times said
      The newspaper said the interagency government study found
  a serious oildependency problem due to steadily falling
  domestic production and rising demand for imported oil
      The study concluded that by 1995 the US Will be relying
  on foreign countries for 50 pct of its oil more than the peak
  of 48 pct reached in 1977 and far above the 33 pct rate during
  the 197374 Arab oil embargo
      The US Now imports about 38 pct of its oil needs up from
  27 pct a year ago the New York Times said
      It said recommendations sent to the White House by Energy
  Secretary John Harrington include financial incentives to raise
  domestic oil production by one mln barrels a day from the
  current 84 mln barrels
      The newspaper said the administration has placed increased
  emphasis on stockpiling oil reserves It said the view now held
  is that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be tapped in times
  of shortages should be increased by 100000 barrels a day
  rather than 35000 as called for in the 1988 budget
     The newspaper said Harrington may propose restoring the
  depletion allowance to major producers
      The administration also plans to renew its efforts to
  Repeal the windfall profits tax remove bars to drilling on
  the outer continental shelf and repeal the law that limits the
  use of natural gas in industrial and utility boilers it added
      The New York Times quoted Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma
  as saying the study greatly underestimated potential US
  Demand for imported oil in the next decade and overestimated
  the amount of domestic oil which would be produced
