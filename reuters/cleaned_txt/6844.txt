AIR CANADA COURIER BUY SHARPLY ALTERS INDUSTRY
  Air Canadas 54 mln US dlr
  acquisition of Gelco Corps ltGEC Canadian unit has
  dramatically altered Canadas fast growing courier industry
  largely dominated by US companies until this year company
  officials and analysts said
      Stateowned Air Canada takes over the countrys second
  largest overnight courier business just two months after
  another Canadian company ltOnex Capital Corp Ltd approved the
  acquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from New
  Jerseybased Purolator Courier Corp ltPCC
      But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted by
  financial restructuring undertaken by the US parent companies
  and likely dont represent an industry trend toward buying out
  foreign owned courier operations
      Its a case of whether you can buy from the right people at
  the right time McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analyst
  Tony Hine commented
      The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by US
  companies embroiled in a takeover or restructuring to selloff
  their Canadian units to generate ready cash said Nesbitt
  Thomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin
      There is a very good correlation between the US parent
  selling Canadian subsidiaries and the US parent either being
  under siege or taking someone else over he said
      Gelco Corp of Minnesota decided to sell Gelco Express Ltd
  as part of its previously announced program to sell off four
  operating units to buy back shares and pay down debt Gelco
  Express marketing vice president James ONeil told Reuters
      The sale is the first under Gelcos divestiture program
  and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln US dlrs of
  debt by yearend the company said
      While company officials declined to disclose earnings and
  revenue figures ONeil said Gelco Express holds a dominant
  position in the industry handling more than 50000 packages a
  day and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrs
  a year
      The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unit
  formed an important part of a company restructuring program
  adopted after another Canadian Company ltUnicorp Canada Corp
  acquired a 126 pct stake in Purolator and said it would
  consider acquiring the whole company
      Last month Purolator agreed to be acquired by a company
  formed by EF Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of
  Purolators US courier business
      For Air Canada its acquisition of Gelcos Canadian courier
  business represents an excellent financial investment in a
  market it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually spokesman
  Esther Szynkarsky said
      The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake in
  EMS Corp of Calgary an incity messenger service
      It did not disclose financial terms but Szynkarsky said
  the two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs and
  the two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs
      She said the acquisition fit with Air Canadas strategy of
  seeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline
  business
      Gelco will continue to operate with current management
  independently of Air Canada although Air Canada already
  operates its own air cargo business that includes a small
  doortodoor courier operation
      Theyre well run theyre a good investment theyre doing
  well in a growing market and thats the way we want to keep
  it Szynkarsky said
      Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian units
  will likely retain operating links with their US delivery
  network generating traffic for the former parent companies
  without them having to tie up capital in Canada
      The nature of the business is that incremental traffic is
  incremental revenue Hine said
      Its sort of a sausage maker business where you put in
  place the sausage grinder and the more sausage you can stuff
  through the more money you make he added
