LAWSON REMARKS DASH HOPES OF EARLY UK RATE CUT
  Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
  Lawsons remarks yesterday suggesting there are precise
  exchange rate targets for the pound undermined sterling
  dashing hopes for an early cut in UK Base rates analysts
  said
      But the markets reaction testing exchange rate levels
  indicated by Lawson was probably overdone and the longer term
  outlook for sterling remained bullish they agreed
      In an apparent break with the previous policy of secrecy
  Lawson told a National Economic Development Council meeting he
  was comfortable with sterling exchange rates around current
  levels specifying rates of around 190 marks and 160 dlrs
      Lawson added the UK Government intended to keep sterling
  at about present levels using currency intervention and
  interest rates to achieve this
      The February 22 Paris agreement of the Group of Five and
  Canada to stabilise exchange rates is widely believed to
  include target ranges but all participants to the meeting had
  so far refused to specify these
      Markets were quick to react to the statement chopping
  about one US Cent and over one pfennig off the pound to match
  the levels mentioned by Lawson
      But most analysts polled said they did not believe Lawsons
  statement signalled a change in UK Policy
      Keith Skeoch chief economist at stockbrokers James Capel
  and Co said the remarks have been blown out of proportion
  Lawson is paying now for a little bit of a slip of the tongue
      Barclays de Zoete Wedd economist Mark Brett said there is
  nothing great and fantastic in the Chancellors statement
      He said he did not believe the rates indicated by the
  Chancellor were precise targets but merely represented central
  rates around which sterling would be allowed to fluctuate
  perhaps by as much as 10 pct
      It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an
  election  I dont believe Lawson is mad enough to tie
  himself to a fixed rate Brett said
      Currency markets were keen for official statements to
  clarify the scope of the Paris accord and reactivate currency
  trading This mood easily led to overreaction analysts said
      Making similar statements when the market is high strung
  and ready to bounce is perhaps a mistake one senior dealer
  with a US Bank said
      Capels Skeoch said it gives the foreign exchange markets
  something to shoot at
      It is obvious that the government as a member of the Group
  of Six has agreed exchange rate bands But they are not cut in
  stone they can change with time Skeoch said
      Brett said we think the 290 marks level is a central
  rate Give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine
      Not all analysts played down the significance of the
  remarks however Chris Dunn economist at Royal Bank of
  Canada said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulate
  sterling from the fortunes of the dollar
      Although about twothirds of Britains trade is conducted
  with European countries sterling has traditionally shadowed
  the dollar rather than the mark analysts noted
      Britain must decide whether it wants to follow the US Or
  throw in its lot with Europe Dunn said
      It suggests that while the UK Is not actually applying to
  join the European Monetary System it is seeking protection by
  shadowing it  The Bundesbank has made it clear that it wants
  the UK To clarify its position relative to the mark he said
      Analysts said sterlings dip on currency markets following
  Lawsons remarks made an early halfpoint cut in UK Base
  rates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term
      Over the next three weeks a cut is out unless we get some
  extremely good economic indicators Capels Skeoch said
      Base rates have been cut twice by onehalf point in March
  the last after the March 17 budget presentation and analysts
  had been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards
