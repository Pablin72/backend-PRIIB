OREGON LUMBER COMPANY TO SELL WOOD TO IRAQ
  A Portlandbased wood
  products company has signed a 13 mln dlr contract with the
  Iraqi government to supply finished softwood lumber to Iraq
  Edward Niedermeyer president of NiedermeyerMartin Co said
  yesterday
      Niedermeyer told the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on
  International Economic Policy and Trade in Washington that the
  sales agreement contains an option that could make lumber
  exported worth more than 20 mln dlrs
      The delivery of about 80 mln dlrs worth of plywood in
  addition to lumber hinges on whether the US Department of
  Agriculture will interpret plywood as an agricultural commodity
  under the credit guarantee program he said
      Niedermeyer said the government export credit guarantee
  program GSM102 administered by the USDA was the key to
  opening the Iraqi market which up to now had been captured by
  Scandinavian lumber producers
      This is the first time we have been able to sell wood
  products in Iraq he said Without the USDA program it would
  not have been possible We hope this will lead to a long term
  export market for US lumber products
      He said the contract calls for supplying 21 mln board feet
  to 30 mln board feet of softwood lumber for housing
  construction and furniture manufacturing He estimated the
  profit potential for his company on the sale at five to six
  pct
      Niedermeyer spent two weeks in Baghdad negotiating the sale
  late last month and early March He is a member of the United
  StatesIraq Business Forum a nonprofit group designed to
  promote commerce with Iraq
      The forum members include Westinghouse and General
  Electric but Niedermeyers company is the only wood products
  firm on the membership roster
