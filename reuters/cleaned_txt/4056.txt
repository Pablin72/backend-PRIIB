SKOREA TO BUY MORE COTTON ESPECIALLY US COTTON
  South Korea plans to import about 387000
  tonnes of cotton this year compared to 225000 tonnes in 1986
  trade ministry officials said
      More than three quarters of the total some 290000 tonnes
  will come from the United States That will be a 937 pct
  increase on 1986 when US Imports totalled 150000 tonnes an
  official said
      He said the US Increase is due partly to the
  competitiveness of American cotton and partly to efforts by
  Seoul to reduce its trade surplus with Washington South Korea
