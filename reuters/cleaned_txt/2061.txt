ROYAL DUTCHSHELL US EARNINGS SHARPLY LOWER
  Royal DutchShell Group ltRDAS earnings
  for 1986 from the US Fell sharply because of difficult market
  conditions lower crude and gas prices and also due to
  different accounting methods Shell chairman Peter Holmes said
      The Shell Oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year
  while the additional effect of currency movements reduced the
  contribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg
      The group earlier reported a drop in net income for the
  year to 254 billion stg from 303 billion previously with
  lower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales by
  volume
      Although the figures were lower they were nonetheless at
  the top end of market forecasts Shell Transport and Trading
  Plc ltSCL shares the UK Arm of the group rose to 1139 stg
  from a close last night of 1106 stg Analysts noted that a
  general collapse in exploration and production volumes was
  partially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln
  stg from 205 mln in 1985
      Also a windfall tax credit and lower than expected
  currency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter
  results which was the main reason for the figures exceeding
  forecasts industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete
  Wedd noted
      However he added there could well be a sharp fall in
  performance in the first quarter of 1987 due to the
  improbability that the group would be able to repeat the high
  refining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986
      The impact of recovering oil prices would come through
  faster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a
  high proportion of upstream activity centred on gas which
  typically reacted to oil price changes with about a halfyear
  lag analysts said
      Holmes said that in the upstream US Sector the third
  quarter of 1986 had been the worst of all
      Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in
  the period with Shell Oil being one of them The decrease in
  US Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group
  had increased share to become volume market leader Holmes
  added
      Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue
  US Exploration activity Exploration is currently pretty
  flat We are going to go on but at 1618 dlrs there will be no
  massive upturn he said
      A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the North
  Sea and the US Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel
      Ultimately this would lead to a rise in US Imports If
  you are not exploring you are not going to find anything he
  noted
      US Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day
  bbd in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed
  below 20 dlrs a barrel
      This favored OPECs attempts to stabilise prices as the
  lower the price the more likelihood there was of nonOPEC
  marginal production shutting down OPEC has done pretty
  extraordinarily wellEverything is moving in its direction
