US MARKET LOAN NOT THAT ATTRACTIVEBOSCHWITZ
  A marketing loan for US wheat
  feedgrains and soybeans would do nothing to help the surplus
  production situation and would be extremely costly Sen Rudy
  Boschwitz RMinn said
      I think I would not support a marketing loan now he told
  the House agriculture subcommittee on wheat soybeans and
  feedgrains Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of a
  marketing loan for cotton and rice but has since focused
  support on decoupling legislation the BorenBoschwitiz bill
      A market loan for grains and soybeans would encourage more
  production especially in highyielding areas would be much
  more expensive than the current cotton and rice marketing loans
  and not increase exports significantly he said
