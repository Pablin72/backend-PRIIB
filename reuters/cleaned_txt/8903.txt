COLOMBIA COFFEE REVENUE SHARPLY DOWN IN JANFEB
  Colombias coffee export revenue dropped
  97 mln dlrs to 2336 mln dlrs for the first two months of the
  year against 3309 mln dlrs in the similar period of 1986
  central bank preliminary figures show
      Experts attributed the fall to lower world market prices
  following the failure to reintroduce international coffee
  export quotas but they said Colombia could compensate the drop
  with higher exports in calendar 1987
      Coffee export revenue for 1986 was 233 billion dlrs
  according to the bank
      Jorge Cardenas manager of the National Coffee Growers
  Federation last week estimated the recent drop of 30 cents a
  lb in coffee prices would mean a net loss revenue of 457 mln
  dlrs for Colombia
      But he stressed that Colombia with stockpiles of 10 mln
  60kg bags had the capacity to export more and would use a
  recentlyintroduced more flexible marketing policy to do so
