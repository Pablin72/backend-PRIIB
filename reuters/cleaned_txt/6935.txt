  European sugar output on the basis of
  three year average yields will be over half a mln tonnes white
  value down on last year although yields do vary widely from
  year to year broker C Czarnikow said in its market review
      European Community sowings are likely to be down compared
  with last year There have been suggestions these sowings might
  respond to the recent upsurge in world prices but Czarnikow
  said it is not the sort of fact that easily becomes known
      The broker bases its forecasts on Licht planting estimates
  which put W Germany the Netherlands and USSR lower but
  Hungary Romania Poland Turkey and Yugoslavia higher
