DOLLAR EXPECTED TO FALL DESPITE INTERVENTION
  Central bank intervention in the
  foreign exchange markets succeeded in staunching the dollars
  losses today but senior dealers here believe the US currency
  is headed for a further retreat
      Although the intervention was widespread dealers perceive
  that the six major industrial nations have differing levels of
  commitment to their recent accord to stabilize currencies
      Moreover hard economic realities hold greater sway over
  the currency market than central bank intervention and these
  argue for a further dollar decline dealers said
      The market can be bigger than the central banks And
  economic fundamentals will always come to the fore said a
  dealer at one major US bank
      As the dollar dropped to postWorld War II lows against the
  yen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan
  Federal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in the
  markets on behalf of the US currency
      Reports of the authorities actions helped the dollar
  recover to about 14945 yen in New York this afternoon from
  the postwar low of 14820 yen in the Far East But it still
  failed to regain Mondays US closing level of 1500005 yen
      Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 15
  billion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollars
  yesterday in the US via the Federal Reserve
      Meanwhile there were strong rumors in New York that the
  Fed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 14850 yen
  today Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchased
  a small amount of dollars for yen
      The Feds last confirmed intervention was on January 28
  when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank of
  Japan But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to have
  signalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 187 marks
      The authorities actions appeared to back up the February
  22 Paris pact between the US Japan West Germany Britain
  France and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperate
  to foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels
      But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed by
  the authorities intervention which they said can only soften
  extreme moves in the market
      For one thing some dealers believed that the Feds
  purchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather than
  for the US central banks own account suggesting a rather  
  watereddown American commitment to the currency accord
      The Bank of Englands action also was thought to be
  completed on behalf of the Japanese central bank reinforcing
  the markets view that Japan is the most resolute of the six
  nations in its support of the currency pact
      Noone doubts the Bank of Japan is serious But the other
  two central banks seem to be making more token gestures than
  anything else said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp
      Im not convinced the intervention was concerted said
  Earl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago 
  Its a yen problem more than anything else
      Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionist
  sentiment in the US limits the extent to which the American
  authorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen
      The dollars break below the key 150 yen level ties the
  Treasurys hands behind its back The US cannot intervene on
  its own account because of the strength of protectionism here
  said Albert Soria of Swiss Bank Corp
      Such comments reflect the view that the currency markets
  are becoming increasingly politicized Despite official
  denials some traders still feel the US would countenance a
  lower dollar to help trim the nations trade deficit
      The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise trade
  deficit in 1986 was with Japan
      Indeed US Treasury secretary James Bakers comment on
  Sunday that the February currency pact had not established
  dollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell the
  US currency and kicked off the latest retreat
      The dollar still has more room on the downside against the
  yen based on the frictions in trade and financial services The
  currency market is becoming very political said Natsuo Okada
  of Sumitomo Bank Ltd
      Okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yen
  this week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the end
  of April or early May
      Even if West Germany and Japan succeed in stimulating their
  economies it may not be enough to solve structural economic
  imbalances in the near future dealers said
      Even if Japan and West Germany do expand this year it
  wont be enough to help the trade situation much said
  Bourdain of BankAmerica who also expects the dollar to drop to
  148 yen in the next couple of days
