BRIERLEY OFFER FOR PROGRESSIVE STILL VALID
  ltBrierley Investments Ltd BIL
  said its offer of 420 NZ Dlrs per share for supermarket
  group ltProgressive Enterprises Ltd still stands although
  ltRainbow Corp Ltd said today it has 52 pct of Progressive
      BIL said in a statement it will review events on a daily
  basis
      Rainbow announced earlier that it had increased its stake
  in Progressive to 52 pct from 44 pct through the purchase of
  94 mln shares at between 380 and 480 NZ Dlrs per share
      BIL chief executive Paul Collins said All Rainbow has done
  is to outlay a substantial amount of cash to purchase shares
  from parties who presumably were supportive of the merger
      Rainbow has proposed a merger with Progressive to form a
  new company ltAstral Pacific Corp Ltd Under the merger
  shareholders in both Progressive and Rainbow will be issued
  shares in the new company on a oneforone basis
      Quite simply Rainbow should now bid for the balance of
  Progressive Enterprises at 480 NZ Dlrs per share Collins
  said
