MORGAN GRENFELL SAYS 1986 PROFITS HIT BY GUINNESS
  ltMorgan Grenfell Group Plc said its
  1986 pretax profits were lower than forecast because of
  depreciation in the value of its Guinness Plc ltGUINL shares
  and because of securities trading losses in the US
      Morgan chairman Lord Catto said the losses on the groups
  seven mln Guinness shares in addition to a 35 mln dlr loss on
  its risk arbitrage operation in New York depressed profits some
  eight mln stg to 822 mln
      He also told a news conference Morgan had received informal
  approaches about a takeover of the group but was not
  interested No formal offers had been made but Catto would not
  elaborate
      Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness during
  the brewing companys successful bid for Distillers Co Plc
  ltDISTL in the first half of last year
      The UK Government launched an investigation into the
  affairs of Guinness last December Public concern has focused
  on the way Guinness may have breached UK Company law and the
  Takeover Code by prompting others to support its share price
  during the bid
      Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves head of
  corporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate finance
  director Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinness
  affair
      Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive Geoffrey Collier
  resigned late last year on allegations of trading on insider
  information He currently faces criminal charges
      Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been one of the
  most traumatic in our history but that clients and staff had
  been supportive
      I certainly look on the future in a positive way We have
  the worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet
      Profits for the year up 194 pct from 1985 pretax profits
  of 688 mln stg were mainly due to a high contribution from
  corporate finance activities and progress in asset management
      Finance Director David Ewart told the news conference the
  performance of the group so far in 1987 was within reasonable
  touch of the budget
      Lord Catto also said the group was actively seeking a new
  chief executive to replace Sir Peter Carey who is acting as
  interim director after Reeves resignation and hopes to have a
  new chief executive within a few months
      He also said Reeves and Walsh had been paid a total of
  562000 stg in compensation following their resignations but
  declined to say how much each man got Negotiations were going
  on to determine an amount of compensation for Seelig he said
      Morgan Grenfell shares stood at a late 366p 9p down on
  yesterdays 375p
