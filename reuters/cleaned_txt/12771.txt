SWISS 1988 INFLATION SEEN AT TWO PCT  INSTITUTE
  Swiss inflation is likely to rise in 1987
  and 1988 because of inflationary tendencies in the domestic
  economy the Centre for Economic Research of the Federal
  Institute of Technology said in its spring review
      It forecast a rise in consumer prices of two pct in 1988
  compared with 13 pct in 1987 Low import prices in 1986 helped
  to keep annual inflation down to 08 pct
      The centre said that in general the outlook for the Swiss
  economy in 1987 and 1988 remained favourable despite the more
  difficult international economic climate facing export
  industry
      The centre repeated its previous forecast that growth in
  Swiss domestic product would slow to 22 pct in 1987 from 25
  pct in 1986 It revised its forecast for 1988 GDP growth to 17
  pct from 16 pct in its last autumn review
      Domestic demand will continue to replace exports as the
  motor of economic growth Private consumption will grow by
  three pct in 1987 and two pct in 1988 against 375 pct in 1986
      Growth in goods exports will slow to 175 pct in 1987 from
  21 pct in 1986 but pick up slightly to 25 pct in 1988 All
  three figures are well below the Swiss average for recent
  years In 1985 for example exports increased by 91 pct
      The centre said the strength of the Swiss franc which has
  firmed sharply in recent months would continue to put pressure
  on Swiss exporters
      It forecast that imports of goods would grow by a more
  modest 45 pct in 1987 and 325 pct in 1988 than in 1986 when
  import prices fell substantially and imports rose by 82 pct
      Industrial production will grow by 16 pct in 1987 and 12
  pct in 1988 compared with 42 pct in 1986
