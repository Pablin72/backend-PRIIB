COMALCO SAYS LOWER COSTS HELPED RETURN TO PROFITS
  Comalco Ltd ltCMACS said its return
  to profit reflected reduced costs improved primary aluminium
  prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture
      It said the earlier reported 571 mln dlr profit for the
  year ended December 31 against a 6913 mln dlr loss in 1985 was
  also aided by lower interest rates on US Dollar debt and
  greater sales of bauxite and aluminium
      Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per
  share final dividend delayed until July 1 to take advantage of
  proposed dividend imputation laws
      This would make five cents for the year against a first and
  final of one cent in 1985
      Comalco said the aluminium industry continued to suffer
  from low prices and excess capacity though the weak Australian
  dollar had helped earnings
      Withdrawal from the ltShowa Aluminium Industries KK joint
  venture had been recapitalised in expansion by the ltNew Zealand
  Aluminium Smelters Ltd project with Japans ltSumitomo
  Aluminium Smelting Co Ltd permitting repayments and increases
  in liquid funds totalling 165 mln dlrs it said
      As previously reported Comalcos ltCommonwealth Aluminium
  Corp unit has conditionally agreed to sell its smelter at
  Goldendale Washington and port facilities at Portland Oregon
  to ltColumbia Aluminium Corp
      Comalco said it had made a 273 mln dlr extraordinary
  provision for Goldendale losses and closure costs but that if
  the sales agreement were completed it would reduce the
  provision made in the 1986 accounts
      The other items in the total extraordinary loss of 1405
  mln dlrs were a 1029 mln writeoff of unrealised exchange
  losses and 103 mln for an increase in future tax provision
