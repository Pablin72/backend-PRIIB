LEADING ECONOMISTS CALL FOR MORE GROWTH ABROAD
  A panel of four leading economists
  told a congressional hearing today that foreign economies will
  need to expand to avoid recession as the US trade deficit
  declines
      C Fred Bergsten a former senior Treasury Department
  official and Robert Solomon of the Brookings Institution told
  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the major exporting
  countries risk recession if they do not expand because US
  demand for imports is expected to fall
      They need to beef up domestic demand as their trade
  surplus falls or unemployment will keep growing Bergsten
  said
      Bergsten predicted the US trade deficit which hit 169
  billion dlrs last year will fall 3040 billion dlrs a year for
  the next two years as a result of the dollars 3540 pct
  decline since September 1985
      The government should intervene to push the dollar down
  further if the previous declines do not lead to an improvement
  in the trade picture if the US budget deficit is not reduced
  and if foreign expansion does not occur he added
      Solomon said the dollar must fall further to compensate for
  the huge interest payments required on US foreign debt The
  Paris agreement between the major industrialized countries
  provided only for a pause in its decline he said
      Rimmer de Vries senior vice president of Morgan Guaranty
  Trust Co said the US trade deficit problem is a problem of
  lagging growth in industrial economies prolonged currency
  misalignment debt problems of the developing countries and
  unbalanced growth in the Asian industrializing countries
      John Makin of the American Enterprise Institute suggested
  foreign tax cuts to increase demand and pick up the slack from
  the US trade deficit fall
