JAPAN ECONOMY MAY BE NEAR BOTTOM ECONOMISTS SAY
  The worst may be just about over for
  Japans battered economy but economists said they do not expect
  a vigorous recovery anytime soon Japanese bank economists
  polled by Reuters said the economys 18 monthold slowdown is
  likely to end in the first half of this year helped by rising
  exports steppedup government spending and falling prices The
  economy will bottom out in the middle of the year said
  Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Masahiko Koido
      Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu
  Taketomi agreed It the bottom is in the offing he said
      But he added that the recovery will be slow Growth in the
  fiscal year beginning next month will only pickup 22 pct
  from two pct in the current year he said
      Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worst
  are increasing
      The volume of exports in the first two months of the year
  rose slightly on a yearonyear basis after declining toward
  the end of last year
      Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as a
  sharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks
  several economists said it could mark the beginning of a
  recovery
      Industrial production fell 07 pct in January much smaller
  than expected and is forecast by the government to rise 03
  pct in February and 26 pct in March A Bank of Japan survey
  released last week showed that the decline in Japanese
  corporate earnings may be nearing its end
      And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopes
  the rapid yen rise has come to the end they said
      Six nations  the UK Canada France Japan the US And
  West Germany  pledged in Paris last month to stabilise
  currencies around current levels
      The yens 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two
  years has hit the exportdriven economy hard by forcing its
  companies to raise prices and lose sales in the US Market
      The important thing is the exchange rate Taketomi said
      If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise
  investment in plant and equipment although there are no signs
  of that yet economists said
      A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their
  competitive edge just as the US economy may be starting to
  recover economists said
      Domestically the economy may get a boost from some
  loosening of the governments tight fiscal policy said Haruo
  Muto manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd
      The next reading of the economys health should come early
  next week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter
  1986
      Most private economists expect a rise of about 05 pct from
  the previous quarter In the third quarter GNP rose 06 pct
      But a senior government official said the fourth quarter
  figures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point
  quarteronquarter But he added that would be a statistical
  aberration and not a significant shift in economic activity
      To maintain yearonyear growth of around 25 pct the
  economy would have had to rise about 12 pct in the fourth
  quarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong
       The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a
  statistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of
  1986 the official said
      Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also
  distorted by the governments sale of gold coins in the second
  half of 1986
      Because the coins were classified as legal tender their
  purchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer
  expenditure Consumer spending also tailed off in December
  because of bad weather and smallerthannormal endyear
  bonuses they said
      As the government had to buy back some of the coins from
  retailers because they were unsold the governments
  contribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been
  boosted economists said
      Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from
  government buying of farm products as the domestic crop last
  year was good
      The senior government official said the fourth quarter
  performance of the domestic sector was probably worse than
  generally expected while that of the external sector was
  better
