  Danishbased insulin and enzymes
  producer Novo Industri AS NVOCO said pretax earnings fell
  almost 10 pct in 1986 though sales rose by two pct
      The pretax figure fell to 788 mln crowns from 872 mln in
  1985 on sales increased from 41 billion to 42 billion
  giving net earnings of 521 mln crowns against 604 mln in 1985
      Earnings per 20crown share went from 2379 crowns to 2045
  crowns but the company proposed an unchanged 20 pct dividend
      Foreign exchange fluctuations in 1986 were a very
  significant factor behind developments in the result before and
  after tax Novo said in a statement
      Not only the US Dollar but also other currencies
  essential to Novo fell in 1986 in relation to the Danish crown
  the statement added
      In November 1986 Novo purchased 75 pct of shares in AS
  Ferrosan which heads a group specialising in research and
  development of CNS central nervous treatment treatments and
  the sale of pharmaceuticals and vitamins in Scandinavia
      The 357 mln crowns paid in goodwill had a very limited
  effect on the 1986 result the Novo statement said
