US MONEY GROWTH SLOWS SHARPLY ECONOMISTS SAY
  US money supply growth is slowing
  down rapidly and some economists believe that all three of the
  Federal Reserves main monetary aggregates may even have
  contracted in February
      A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for the
  Fed especially as it would follow a long period of torrid
  growth but it could give the central bank extra leeway in the
  weeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policy
  was justified on account of weakness in the economy    
      M1 money supply for the week ended February 23 reported
  today rose 19 billion dlrs to 7385 billion but preliminary
  forecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs
  The monthly average in January was 7371 billion dlrs
      M1 makes up about a quarter of M2 and a fifth of M3
  With other components of M2 such as moneymarket deposit
  accounts and small time deposits also falling the stage is
  set for falls in the broader aggregates too economists say
      M1 has been largely discredited because its traditional
  link to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact of
  falling interest rates and banking deregulation
      But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates is
  likely to impress the Fed said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch
  Economics Inc
      The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when theyre all
  sending the same signal This is going to raise some eyebrows
  at the Fed McCarthy said
      Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added We
  have some very goodlooking monetary aggregate data Its
  coming in a lot weaker than I thought    
      The economists were quick to caution that one months data
  prove nothing especially because money growth previously had
  been so rapid M1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 167 pct
  rate and at a 191 pct rate in the past 13 weeks
      Moreover some of the contraction in M2 can probably be
  explained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the
  booming stock market and is thus not an indication of a
  slowdown in the business expansion
      But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond
  markets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a
  reflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus
      McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with
  signs that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter
  progresses Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as
  they were a month ago he noted
      He expects only five to six pct M1 growth in March and
  rises in M2 and M3 of about four pct
      Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M1 and five pct
  or less for M2 and M3 but the rates would still be moderate
  enough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national
  product for the first quarter proved to be weak Youd
  certainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past
      There was certainly nothing in the Feds latest balance
  sheet however to suggest a change of policy is already under
  way economists said Discount window borrowings were in line
  with expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day
      Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc
  argued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much to
  solve Americas most urgent economic problem its massive trade
  deficit Because of the possibility that further dollar
  depreciation  and thus rising inflation  may be needed to
  close the trade gap Brusca said Im not prepared to be all
  that optimistic about the bond market
