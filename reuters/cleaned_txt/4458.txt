OTTAWA SEEKS EXPLANATION OF CREDIT CARD RATES
  Minister of State for Finance Tom Hockin
  said he has asked the Canadian Bankers Association an industry
  lobby group for an explanation of the level of credit card
  interest rates
      Hockin said he hopes to here the associations response on
  the important issue soon Hockin was responding to questions
  in the House of Commons about why credit card rates which run
  as high as 28 pct per year remain high when other rates are
  falling
      Today the Canadian bank rate fell to 728 pct from 754
  pct last week and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce cut
  its prime rate effective tomorrow to 875 pct from 925 pct
