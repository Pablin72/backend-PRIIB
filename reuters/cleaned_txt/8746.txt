US ECONOMY SHOWS PROMISING SIGNS OF GROWTH
  The US economy is showing some
  promising signs of accelerated expansion despite the
  sluggishness of the fourth quarter last year private
  economists say
      Some of the slowness experienced in the OctoberDecember
  period had been expected to spill over into the first quarter
  this year as the tax law changes that went into effect in
  January slowed business and consumer spending
      But some of the latest economic data show signs of
  surprising strength in the US economy although some
  economists remain cautious about the outlook
      The Commerce Department reported today that new orders for
  durable goods in February jumped by 57 billion dlrs a six pct
  rise to 1012 billion dlrs Even excluding volatile defense
  goods durable goods orders rose a healthy 38 pct the agency
  said
      The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many
  financial analysts whose predictions ranged from flat to
  increases of up to five pct
      The JanuaryFebruary employment statistics suggest the
  Gross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for
  the first three months of this year said Lyle Gramley an
  economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association
      The US jobless rate in February and January was 67 pct
  the lowest rate since March 1980 The number of new nonfarm
  jobs rose by 337000 in February after a 319000 gain in
  January and a 225000 December increase the government said
      The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of
  about three to 325 pct in the first quarter said Gramley
      Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding
  their inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the
  second quarter Gramley said He expects a slowdown in the
  second quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption
  and government spending He also sees residential construction
  declining mostly for multifamily housing units
      Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the
  fourth quarter slowness will continue
      Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 15 pct rate in the
  first quarter of 1987 accelerate during the second quarter and
  show a brisk 45 pct annual rate in the third quarter
      The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the
  US trade balance which is expected because of the decline in
  the dollars value over the last year and half
      The improvement will be gradual and long lasting Levy
  predicted Most of it will be through import reduction but at
  least onethird will be due to a rise in product exports as the
  prices of US goods become more attractive overseas
      The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit
  which soared to record levels last year will improve this year
  and the US economy will grow by a respectable 32 pct for the
  year compared with a 25 pct rate last year
      As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit the US
  has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their
  domestic demand for goods from the US and others
      US officials believe that would help take some of the
  pressure off the United States whose five years of economic
  growth has been the mainstay of developing countries
      The US economy provided them with a giant market for
  their goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to
  service their foreign debt
      The government last week said the US economy grew at a
  modest 11 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter
      There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance
  between the volume of goods imported to the United States and
  those shipped abroad The report showed a rising volume of
  exports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact
  that in current dollar terms the US trade deficit worsened
  during the closing three months of 1986
      While fourth quarter economic growth was weak corporate
  profits jumped a healthy 61 pct during the period the
  government said It also reported that inflation as measured
  by the GNP price deflator remained in check growing a
  moderate 07 pct in the period the lowest rise in 19 years
      The government also reported that consumer spending a key
  element of the five year economic recovery jumped 17 pct in
  February after falling two pct in January
      The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the
  manufacturing sector which had been one of the weaker elements
  of the US economy was showing signs of recovery
      In its latest report on current economic conditions the
  Fed said that economic activity in the various regions of the
  country ranged from uneven or steady to improving
  Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most
  regions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish
      Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the
  pick up in the US manufacturing sector is largely due to the
  drop in the dollars value He said he does not foresee a major
  pick up in economic activity but does not believe the economy
  will slip into recession either
      He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts
  that have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze
  consumers purchasing power
      That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of
  years Chimerine said He sees economic growth hovering around
  a modest two pct level for the next few years
