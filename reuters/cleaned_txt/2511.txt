FAVORED TRADE STATUS FOR MOSCOW STILL OPPOSED
  The Reagan administration wants to
  encourage expanded trade with the Soviet Union but does not
  believe Moscow yet warrants mostfavorednation treatment
  Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said
      It seems to me that more trade between us is better than
  less trade he told a forum on USSoviet trade relations
      To that end the administration in January allowed foreign
  policy controls on the export of oil and gas equipment to the
  Soviet Union to lapse he said
      Also Washington and its allies are reviewing remaining
  export controls in hopes of simplifying the list of prohibited
  items and speeding up the licensing process he said
      Whitehead said however the prefential treatment that
  comes with mostfavorednation status is out for the moment
      US law prohibits mostfavorednation status for countries
  that restrict emigration and other rights
      What we have seen so far in improved rights under Soviet
  Leader Mikhail Gorbachev are promising trends he said
      But he added We dont know if they will continue we
  dont know how significant they will be
