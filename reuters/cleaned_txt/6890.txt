ARGENTINE MAIZE SOYBEAN FORECASTS FALL
  Argentine grain growers reduced
  their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current
  harvest in the week to yesterday trade sources said
      Soybean production for 198687 is now estimated to reach
  between 77 and eight mln tonnes versus 78 to 82 mln tonnes
  estimated a week ago and eight to 84 mln tonnes estimated in
  midFebruary
      But even the lowest of those estimates would be 85 to 127
  pct greater than last years total of 71 mln tonnes according
  to official figures and would be a new record
      The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a
  record 37 to 38 mln hectares and increased 108 to 138 pct
  compared to the 33 mln hectares planted last year
      The change in yield estimates is due to very high
  temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in
  the soybeanproducing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and
  northern Buenos Aires province
      The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean
  pods empty especially in Cordoba
      Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops since
  rainfall was slight in most main soybeanproducing areas
      Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in
  Buenos Aires province totalling between one and 10 mm There
  was no recorded rain in other grainproducing provinces
      With clear skies and seasonable temperatures fields were
  able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent
  weeks allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize
  sunflower and sorghum harvesting
      Crops were considered in generally good condition though
  it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of
  recent weeks caused any longterm damage
      The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the
  total area planted compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago
      Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at
  358 to 378 mln hectares down two to seven pct from the 385
  mln hectares planted in the previous harvest
      Total production for the current maize harvest is expected
  to reach between 99 and 101 mln tonnes versus 10 to 102 mln
  tonnes estimated a week ago The new figure is 211 to 227 pct
  lower than the 128 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest
  according to official figures
      The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of
  total planted area versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago
      Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two
  to 22 mln hectares or 299 to 363 pct lower than the record
  314 mln hectares planted in the 198586 harvest
      The current harvests volume was again expected to be
  between 23 and 26 mln tonnes or 341 to 415 pct lower than
  last harvests record 41 mln tonnes
      Yields varied widely from area to area and growers feared
  that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on
  crops and consequently on total production volume
      The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of
  total planted area compared to four to six pct a week ago
      Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 12 and
  13 mln hectares or 103 to 152 pct lower than the 14 mln
  hectares planted in the previous harvest
      Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest
  remained at 32 to 35 mln tonnes again this week or 167 to
  22 pct lower than last harvests total volume of 41 to 42 mln
  tonnes
