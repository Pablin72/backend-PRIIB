BOLIDEN TAKES OVER ALLISCHALMERS DIVISION
  Swedish mining and metals group
  Boliden AB said it would buy the mining equipment operations of
  the US AllisChalmers Corp amounting to more than 50 pct of
  group sales for 600 mln crowns
      Boliden president Kjell Nilsson told a news conference the
  acquisition of the AllisChalmers unit which he described as
  the worlds leading producer of equipment for the mineral
  processing industry would yield positive synergy effects for
  Boliden mining metals and engineering operations
      Nilsson said the takeover will provide opportunities to
  cooperate with the mining and materials handling operations of
  Bolidens parent company Trelleborg AB
      He said AllisChalmers was selling out because it needed
  new cash after suffering big losses in its farm equipment
  operation
      The deal is subject to approval by AllisChalmers annual
  meeting company officials said
