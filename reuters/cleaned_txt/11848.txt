HK BANKS TO RAISE PRIME RATES SOON DEALERS SAY
  Banks in Hong Kong are likely to raise
  prime rates by half a percentage point to 612 pct following a
  onequarter point prime rate increase by two major US Banks
  yesterday dealers said
      They told Reuters local banks may decide on the increase at
  this weekends routine meeting of the Hong Kong Association of
  Banks
      GC Goh chief dealer of the Standard Chartered Bank said
  prime rate increases by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank to
  734 pct from 712 may prompt Hong Kong banks to follow suit
      Goh said local banks want to restore the prime to 612
  pct the level at beginning of 1987
      The banks raised the prime to the current six pct from five
  pct on February 28 after cutting it 112 points from 612 on
  January 15 in response to upside pressure on the Hong Kong
  dollar he said
      The medium and longer term interbank rates firmed today
  with three months ending at 5116 to 478 pct against
  yesterdays five to 41316 close The overnight rate however
  fell to 312 to three pct from 412 to four because of
  increased liquidity for a local stock issue
