PARIBAS SEEKING TO ADJUST ECUADOR OIL FACILITY
  Banque Paribas which arranged a 220
  mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to prefinance oil exports
  wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the country
  recover from a devastating earthquake bankers said
      But the French banks plan which would effectively
  postpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for several
  months is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52
  members of the loan syndicate
      The pipeline that carries all Ecuadors oil exports was
  ruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five months
  to repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair
      President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated total
  damages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that
  Ecuador as a result would maintain Januarys suspension of
  interest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt
      Payments were halted in January because of the drop in the
  price of oil which accounts for nearly twothirds of Ecuadors
  export earnings and 60 pct of government revenue
      Although sympathetic to Ecuadors plight many banks in the
  Paribas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a job
  for international financial organizations and not for
  commercial banks bankers said
      The 18month oilfinancing facility which was signed last
  October 28 is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a
  Latin American nation since the regions debt crisis erupted in
  August 1982
      Because it was a voluntary deal many bankers feel strongly
  that the orginal terms must be adhered to Otherwise they
  fear the gradual reestablishment of normal market conditions
  for Latin borrowers will be set back
      Theres a lot of reluctance by the other banks They feel
  its a different facility and so any kind of suggestion of a
  restructuring would look bad one banker commented
