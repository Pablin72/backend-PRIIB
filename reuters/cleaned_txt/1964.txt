UK FOURTH QUARTER TRADE DEFICIT 26 BILLION STG
  Britain had a visible trade deficit of
  26 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised
  deficit of 29 billion in the third quarter official
  statistics show
      Seasonallyadjusted figures issued by the Central
  Statistical Office CSO show the current account was in
  deficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third
  quarter shortfall of 930 mln
      For 1986 as a whole visible trade was in deficit by 83
  billion stg sharply up from 1985s 22 Billion shortfall and
  a 44 billion deficit in 1984
      Preliminary figures for invisible transactions in the
  fourth quarter show a surplus 18 billion stg to give an
  estimated surplus for 1986 of 72 billion The fourth quarter
  figure was in line with CSO projections released on Friday
      The third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to
  19 billion stg from 225 billion
      In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 51 billion stg
      The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarter
  was due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg and
  a reduction in the nonoil trade deficit of 100 mln the CSO
  said
      However 1986s surplus on oil trade was 40 billion stg
  lower than in 1985 while the deficit on nonoil trade
  increased by 21 billion
      The figures were broadly in line with market expectations
      The CSO stressed that figures for invisible transactions
  particularly for the most recent quarters are liable to
  substantial revisions as later information becomes available
