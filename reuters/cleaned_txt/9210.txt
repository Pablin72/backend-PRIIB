RAINBOW LIFTS PROGRESSIVE STAKE TO 52 PCT
  ltRainbow Corp Ltd said it has
  lifted its stake in supermarket group ltProgressive Enterprises
  Ltd to 52 pct from 44 pct
      It said in a statement it has bought an extra 94 mln
  shares at prices ranging from 380 NZ Dlrs to 480
      Progressive is currently the subject of both a proposed
  merger with Rainbow and a full takeover bid from ltBrierley
  Investments Ltd BIL The BIL bid launched on Monday is at
  420 dlrs a share The Rainbow merger involves shareholders in
  both Rainbow and Progressive being issued shares in a new
  company ltAstral Pacific Corp Ltd on a oneforone basis
      Rainbow chief executive Craig Heatley said In our opinion
  BILs actions over the last few days have been undertaken for
  their own strategic purposes which conflict with the desire of
  both companies to merge their interests
      BIL has said it is against the merger because it sees
  Progressive shares as being worth twice as as much as
  Rainbows
      Progressive traded today at 442 Rainbow at 366 and BIL
  at 430 at the end of morning trading on the New Zealand Stock
  Exchange
