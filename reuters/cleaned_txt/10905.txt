ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT  US CONGRESS RAPS JAPAN
  The US Congress is making Japan
  with its enormous worldwide trade surplus the symbol of the
  US trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn around
  Americas record trade deficit
      Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade the
  challenge to our high technology industries the threat of
  government nutured competition and the multitude of barriers
  to our exports Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said
      If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over trade
  problems we can manage our difficulties with other countries
  the West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committee
  hearing on the trade bill
      Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright a Texas Democrat have
  made trade legislation a priority this year and a wideranging
  bill is being readied for probable House approval next month
      Japans bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrs
  in 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year Its surplus rose to 814
  billion dlrs in February from 57 billion dlrs in January
      Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs US trade
  deficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance to
  the dollars decline in world currency markets as a reason to
  press Japan to buy more US goods
      They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration
  in US exports of sophisticated computer technology
      In response to the growing anger and pressure by the US
  semiconductor industry President Reagan Friday announced he
  intended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese
  electronic goods in retaliation for Japans failure to abide by
  a 1986 USJapanese semiconductor agreement
      Congress also has been been angered by the administrations
  lack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issues
  including beef citrus automobile parts telecommunications
  goods and financial services
      The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week in
  four committees It is a package of trade sanctions and
  measures to force the administration take tough action against
  foreign trade barriers and unfair competition
      Although most provisions do not single out Japan in many
  cases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japanese
  products or make them more expensive with higher duties
      The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the House
  Ways and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2 Its focus is to
  force President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign
  competition and to make it easier for US industries to win
  temporary relief from surges in imports
      The most controversial issue an amendment to restrict
  imports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not
  buy more US goods was left for an April vote by the House
      Rep Richard Gephardt a Democratic presidential aspirant
  from Missouri has the support of Wright and other key
  Democrats to press for passage of the amendment
      The measure would have the most impact on Japan West
  Germany Taiwan and South Korea If Japan for example does
  not reduce its barriers by mid1988 the United States would
  set import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten per
  cent a year for three years
      Im tired of going into companies and having managers say
  to me Were not over competing in Japan because we cant
  compete in the marketplace That argument needs to be taken
  away from American business Gephardt said
      The administration has said it could not support a trade
  bill containing such a provision
