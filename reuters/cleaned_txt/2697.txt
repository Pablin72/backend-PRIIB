FRENCH PRIMARY BOND MARKET SHOWS NEW SPARKLE
  The French primary bond market is showing
  signs of renewed effervescence after several weeks of lethargy
  and the trend is expected to continue if hopes of imminent
  interest rate cuts are fulfilled market operators said
      The Bank of France is generally expected to give a signal
  to the market possibly at the beginning of next week by
  announcing a quarter point cut in its intervention rate which
  has stood at eight pct since January 2 or in its sevenday
  repurchase rate set at 834 pct since January 5
      The central banks averagedout day to day call money rate
  the reference rate for interbank money market operators which
  reached 834 pct on February 18 has fallen to 734 pct this
  week dealers noted
      The Bank of Frances open market policy to regulate the
  money markets since December has been based on a floor and
  ceiling of rates within the limits of its intervention and
  seven day repurchase rates
      For the moment the sentiment is of wait and see on rate
  cuts but there are now more optimists than pessimists among
  market operators a dealer for a major French bank said
      Dealers said there is abundant liquidity on the bond
  market noting that this weeks monthly Treasury tap issue of
  1187 billion francs had a good reception and was fairly easily
  absorbed
      The Treasury had set an upper limit on the issue of 12
  billion francs and was likely to continue to try and sell as
  much paper as it could over coming months to meet its borrowing
  needs for this year of around 150 billion one banker said
      Dealers said there was no difficulty in placing liquidity
  in the primary market at the moment despite competition from
  the surge in investments on the Paris stock exchange
      There has been a flood of large bond issues but with
  formulas well adapted to market conditions and investor demand
   with warrants or a mix of fixed and floatingrates  which
  have been snapped up and with generally broadly negative fees
      Dealers pointed to the recent Caisse dAide a lEquipement
  des Collectivites Locales CAECL 890 pct two billion franc
  bond with warrants exchangeable for floatingrate bonds issued
  over 13 years and 80 days at 9704 pct with payment date March
  9 which was today quoted at 090 to 110 pct
      Even classic fixedrate issues after being neglected since
  the end of last year are finding buyers one banker said
      Dealers said that now the question was to see how the terms
  of imminent operations would be set with great market interest
  focussed on the likely three next issues
      These will include an expected four to five billion franc
  issue for Electricite de France to be followed by a bond of
  around one billion francs for Auxiliaire du Credit Foncier a
  subsidiary of the banking group Credit Foncier de France and a
  new issue by tender from the mortgage agency Caisse de
  Refinancement Hypothecaire
