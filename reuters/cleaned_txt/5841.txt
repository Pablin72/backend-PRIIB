TAIWAN SAID CONSIDERING CURRENCY LIBERALISATION
  Taiwans central bank is considering
  proposals to ease currency restrictions to reduce foreign
  exchange reserves of 51 billion US Dlrs a local newspaper
  reported today
      The China Times which has close ties with the government
  quoted central bank governor Chang Chicheng as saying the
  government had agreed in principle to liberalise financial
  restrictions
      The bank was considering proposals to allow firms and
  individuals to hold foreign exchange and invest in foreign
  stocks for the first time Chang was quoted as saying
      All foreign exchange must now be handed to local banks and
  exchanged for local currency Firms and individuals may only
  invest in foreign government bonds treasury bills and
  certificates of deposit
      Central bank and other government officials were not
  available to comment on the report
      Economists said it was likely that the government would
  ease foreign exchange controls but only gradually
      They said vast foreign currency reserves earned mainly
  from huge trade surpluses with the United States made Taiwan a
  target for US Protectionism
      Taiwans trade surplus with the US Rose to 136 billion
  US Dlrs last year compared with 102 billion in 1985
      The central bank has to go in this direction said Su
  Hanmin chief economist with the International Commercial Bank
  of China If they dont quicken the pace Washington could
  retaliate and really damage Taiwan
