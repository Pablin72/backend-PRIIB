GERMAN LONGTERM CAPITAL INFLOW SLUMPS IN FEBRUARY
  The inflow of longterm capital into
  West Germany slumped to 606 mln marks in February from
  Januarys record 1191 billion with foreign purchases of
  German bonds and shares declining sharply the Bundesbank said
      While foreigners bought only four billion marks worth of
  German bonds in February after 13 billion in January they sold
  a net 500 mln marks in shares and promissory notes of public
  authorities after sales worth 300 mln in January
      With German investors purchases of foreign securities
  steady around 13 billion marks only 22 billion marks were
  imported through securities transactions after 112 billion
      Direct investment abroad led to a capital outflow of 160
  billion marks in February after 283 billion in January
      There was a deficit of 814 billion marks in the shortterm
  capital account after a surplus of 194 mln in January
      Banks alone exported some 86 billion marks in funds while
  domestic companies increased their shortterm financial assets
  abroad by 700 mln But public authorities received some one
  billion marks from abroad the Bundesbank said in a statement
      Combining long and short term capital outflows West
  Germany recorded a net outflow of 753 billion marks in
  February against a net inflow of 1191 billion in January
      The Bundesbank confirmed the German trade surplus widened
  to 1045 billion marks in February from Januarys 720 billion
      Taking the two months together the seasonally adjusted
  surplus was slightly below the figure for the previous two In
  terms of current as well as constant prices the narrowing of
  the surplus was progressing the bank said
      Germanys current account surplus widened to 663 billion
  marks in February from 479 billion in January but was down on
  the 726 billion figure for February 1986 Seasonally adjusted
  the February current account surplus narrowed against January
      While exports in February fell a half pct against the same
  month last year imports fell 1012 pct largely due to the
  drop in prices Exports grew three pct in volume and imports
  two pct
      In the balance of services a fall in net investment income
  led to a 300 mln mark deficit in February after a 300 mln mark
  surplus in January
      The deficit in transfer payments widened to 370 billion
  marks from 269 billion largely due to a sharp jump to 23
  billion marks from 200 mln in payments to the European
  Community budget
