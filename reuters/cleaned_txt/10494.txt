DROUGHT CUTS CHINESE WHEAT CROP  USDA REPORT
  Drought has resulted in a reduction
  in Chinas estimated wheat crop this year to 870 mln tonnes
  20 mln below last years harvest the US Agriculture
  Departments officer in Peking said in a field report
      The report dated March 25 said imports in the 198788
  season are projected at 80 mln tonnes 10 mln tonnes above
  the the current seasons estimate
      Imports from the United States are estimated at 15 mln
  tonnes compared to only 150000 tonnes estimated for the
  198687 year it said
      After travelling to major wheat producing areas and
  obtaining more information on the planted area the total
  planted area was estimated down 290000 hectares due to the dry
  fall it said
      The report said to compensate for the below normal
  precipitation irrigation has increased as has the use of
  fertilizer
      While there are pockets where irrigation is not possible
  most of the wheat crop has access to some water and therefore
  has emerged from dormancy and is doing well the report said
      It said scattered rain in many parts of China in the past
  10 days has improved the situation but information on hail
  damage in Anhui is incomplete
