TAIWAN INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT FALLS CURRENCY BLAMED
  Taiwans industrial production index
  fell largely as the result of the rising Taiwan dollar by
  818 pct to 14006 base 1981 in February from a revised
  15253 in January the Economy Ministry said
      It was the second consecutive monthly fall after dropping
  nine pct in January but it was still 2649 pct up on February
  1986 following a very extended rise last year
      The January figure was revised from a preliminary 15482
      A ministry official attributed the decline to falling
  production of nonmetal products textiles and transportation
  equipment and less mining and house construction
      The official said the decline was also caused by falling
  exports in February due to the climb of the Taiwan dollar
  which has made Taiwanese products more expensive
      He expected the decline to continue in the next few months
  because of further appreciation of the local dollar against the
  US Currency
      The Taiwan dollar advanced more than 15 pct against the
  US Dollar since September 1985 It closed at 3440 to the
  US Dollar today and is expected to rise to about 32 to the
  dollar by the end of this year foreign bankers and economists
