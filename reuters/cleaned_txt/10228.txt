OIL EXECUTIVES SEE GRADUAL RISE IN PRICES
  Top executives with Tenneco Corp ltTGT
  and Sabine Corp ltSAB said they expected world oil prices to
  gradually increase over the next two years as US reliance on
  imports of oil from the Middle East grows
       I believe we have bottomed out and can look forward to a
  trend of gradually increasing prices CW Nance president of
  Tenneco Oil Exploration and Production told a meeting of the
  Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association
       Nance predicted that by 1990 the Organization of
  Producing and Exporting Countries would be producing at the
  rate of 80 pct of capacity
      The gain will come largely through increased imports to the
  United States he said
      They will be able to raise the price again but I do not
  think they will raise it as much as they did in 1979 Nance
  said He did not say how much of a price hike he expected
       Andrew Shoup chairman of Dallasbased Sabine predicted
  that world oil prices would increase from a range of 15 to 20
  dlrs a barrel in 1987 to a range of 17 to 22 dlrs a barrel in
  1988 Natural gas prices Shoup said should similarly climb
  from a range of 130 to 170 dlrs per mcf this year to between
  150 and 190 dlrs per mcf in 1988
       Fuel switching could help us as much as five pct in
  increased demand Shoup said referring to the gas industrys
  outlook for 1987 Repeal of the Fuel Use Act a federal law
  prohibiting the use of natural gas in new manufacturing plants
  and utilities could increase demand for gas by as much as 15
  pct he said
       Tennecos Nance also said that some US cities may
  experience peak day shortages in natural gas supplies next
  winter because of the industrys reduced deliverability
       Tennecos gas deliverability for example dropped by 20
  pct during 1986 he said
       This does not mean the gas bubble is gone Nance said
  We believe gas prices have bottomed out The real question is
  how broad the valley is  is it one year two years or three
  years before we start to climb out
        JC Walter of ltWalter Oil and Gas Corp said the recent
  improvement in oil prices was not enough for independent
  producers to begin new onshore drilling projects
       If crude oil stays below 20 dlrs a barrel and 150 dlr
  per mcf for natural gas prevails the prospects for onshore
  exploration at deeper depths in the Texas Gulf Coast by
  independents in the 1990s are pretty dismal Walter said
       He suggested that some independents may instead turn to
  exploration in shallow federal offshore leases Farmout
  agreements cheap rig rates and less competition have held
  finding costs in those areas to five or six dlrs a barrel
  Walter said
