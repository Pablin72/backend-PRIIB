HEAVY RAINS DAMAGE ARGENTINE COARSE GRAINS CROP
  Fresh heavy rains caused further
  damage to the Argentine 198687 coarse grains crop in the week
  to yesterday particularly in Buenos Aires province trade
  sources said
      They said the sunflower maize soybean and sorghum crops
  were damaged and yield estimates affected New production
  forecasts were made for all these crops
      The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered
  more than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and
  worsened the flooding in various parts of the province
      The weather bureau said the rains which in Buenos Aires
  have surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days could continue
      The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains
      In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of
  200 mm in some parts notably the Paso de los Libres area
  bordering on Uruguay
      In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm
  in places in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm
      The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa
      Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be
  further delayed due to dampness in the earth the sources said
      The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the
  crops further dimishing the yield the sources added
      Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to
  30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe Cordoba La Pampa and
  Buenos Aires provinces
      The production forecast for 198687 sunflowerseed has been
  lowered to between 22 and 24 mln tonnes against 23 to 26
  mln tonnes the previous week making it 415 to 463 pct lower
  than the record 41 mln tonnes produced last season
      The area sown was two to 22 mln hectares down 299 to
  363 pct on the record 314 mln hectares in 198586
      The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the
  area sown in Cordoba Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires It
  will begin in La Pampa within about 10 days weather
  permitting
      Maize yield this season is now estimated at 96 to 99 mln
  tonnes against last weeks 99 to 101 mln tonnes down 214
  to 226 pct on the 124 to 126 mln tonnes at which private
  producers put 198586 production
      The new forecast is 227 to 25 pct down on the official
  figure of 128 mln tonnes for last seasons production
      The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers
  targets against 14 to 16 pct the previous week
      The production forecast was reduced to between three and
  33 mln tonnes against 32 to 35 mln tonnes last week 214
  to 268 pct down on last seasons 41 to 42 mln tonnes
      The area sown with sorghum in 198687 was 123 to 130 mln
  hectares down 103 to 152 pct on the 145 mln in 198586
      The forecast for soybean yield this season was the least
  changed in relation to last week It was put at a record 75 to
  77 mln tonnes against the previous 75 to 78 mln tonnes
      These figures are 42 to 55 pct higher than last seasons
  record of 72 to 73 mln tonnes according to private sources
  and 56 to 85 pct up on the official 71 mln tonnes
      The adjustment to the production forecast is due to the
  rains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced the
  sunlight needed for this crop sources said
      Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted down
  further
      The humidity could induce rotting and growers are still
  finding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlier
  in the season
      Soybean harvesting is due to start in midApril in southern
  Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires
