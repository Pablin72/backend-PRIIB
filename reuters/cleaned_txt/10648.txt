BFG PARTIAL OPERATING PROFITS FALL SHARPLY IN 1986
  Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG
  ltBKFGF BfG partial operating profits fell to 1826 mln
  marks in 1986 from 3137 mln in 1985 new majority shareholder
  Aachener und Muenchener BeteiligungsAG ltAMVGF AMB said
      But total operating and extraordinary profits including
  earnings from currency and securities trading on the banks own
  account and earnings from the sale of holdings in other firms
  were more than double the previous years level AMB said
      BfGs 1986 accounts were included in a prospectus for AMBs
  capital increase which is to finance the insurance companys
  acquisition of 50 pct plus one share of BfG
      Despite the fall in partial operating profits BfG paid an
  unchanged 20 mln marks into open reserves and transferred an
  unchanged 80 mln marks to its trade union holding company
  ltBeteiligungsgesellschaft fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG from which
  AMB has acquired the majority stake
      The bank has said its business last year suffered from the
  turbulence around the troubled tradeunionowned housing
  concern Neue Heimat
      AMB said the 500 mln mark drop in BfGs business volume to
  501 billion marks affected the interest surplus
      The interest surplus which fell to 8979 mln marks from
  9811 mln was also depressed by the 01 point fall in the
  interest margin to 19 pct
      A rise in the surplus on commission to 2088 mln marks from
  1881 mln was not enough to compensate for this
      The rise in total operating profits enabled BfG to step up
  risk provisions with country risks particularly emphasised
  because of the continuing difficulties of some countries
      Disclosed risk provisions which under West German
  accounting rules do not necessarily reflect the full amount
  rose to 7363 mln marks from 2240 mln
      BfGs parent credit volume eased to 3263 billion marks in
  1986 from 3351 billion Foreign debtors accounted for 24 pct
  of this credit volume and Latin American debtors accounted for
  147 pct of total lending to foreigners
      BfG posted extraordinary earnings from the sale of 2501
  pct of ltVolksfuersorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung AG 749
  pct of ltBSV Bank fuer Sparanlagen und Vermoegensbildung AG and
  five pct of ltAllgemeine Hypothekenbank AG The sale was linked
  to AMBs acquisition of a majority of BfG
      These sales show up as 4942 mln marks from profit transfer
  agreements and 3265 mln from writing back risk provisions
