COURT PUTS INJUNCTION ON DUTCH PORT REDUNDANCIES
  Employers in Rotterdam ports
  strikehit general cargo sector have been served with an
  injunction until May 7 preventing them from continuing with
  plans for 350 redundancies this year an employers
  organisation spokesman said
      An Amsterdam court yesterday ruled there had been a legal
  fault in the employers redundancy procedure
      The employers spokesman said they were likely to restart
  the redundancy procedure afresh next week in an attempt to
  preempt the May 7 final court ruling
      Port and transport union representative Paul Rosenmuller
  described the court ruling as a victory for the union but
  added there was still a long way to go before the dispute that
  has hit the general cargo sector for the past eight weeks was
  resolved
      Rosenmuller said there would be a meeting of the sectors
  4000 workers this afternoon to decide on further action in the
  campaign of lightning strikes that began on January 19 in
  protest at planned redundancies of 800 starting with 350 this
  year
      The employers said there were no immediate plans for
  meetings with the union either on the proposed redundancies or
  on a new work practice agreement in the sector
      Meanwhile discussions on a new work agreement in the
  ports grain sector due to resume next week are stalemated
  although agreement could be close in the coal and ore sector
  the employers spokesman added
