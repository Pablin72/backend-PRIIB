GERMAN WAGE ROUND SAID TO LIMIT MONETARY OPTIONS
  The Bundesbanks options for West
  Germany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable future
  by the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions and
  employers economists and money market dealers said
      Call money fell in quite active trading today dropping to
  34050 pct from 35565 pct yesterday and below the 350 pct
  treasury bill rate as a difficult monthend approached
      But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikely
  to encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for
  fear of upsetting the current wage round
      One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said I
  dont think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever
  happens But it also does not want them to fall Above all it
  wants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes
      In West Germany unions and employers prepare the ground
  for triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments
  of growth and inflation economists said
      Ute Geipel economist with Citibank AG said if the
  Bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy
  raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the
  medium term unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands
      As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no move
  that would interfere in the negotiating process Geipel said
      In the current round the countrys most powerful union
  the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers is
  demanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the
  present 3812 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages
      The engineering employers association Gesamtmetall is
  offering to bring in a 38hourweek from July 1 1988 and give
  a two stage wage increase  a 27 pct rise from April 1 this
  year and another 15 pct from July 1 1988
      The agreement forged by IG Metall  Europes largest
  union with 25 mln members  and the employers would set the
  benchmark for settlements in other industries such as the
  public sector banks and federal post office Negotiations
  began in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude by
  early April ahead of the traditional holiday period in June
      Though many economists said the unions current warning
  strikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and
  would not lead to a repeat of 1984s damaging sevenweek
  strikes others said unions would not compromise greatly on
  their positions and there could still be conflict
      This could extend the length of time in which the
  Bundesbank would keep its activity lowkey economists said
      The money market head said the unions humiliation by the
  protracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperative
  housing venture would contribute to union obstinacy
      The unions havent forgotten that and they will put this
  squarely onto the account in the negotiations he said
      In addition the newlyelected chairman of the IG Metall
  union Franz Steinkuehler was more radical and determined than
  his predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battle
  to achieve the best possible settlement for his membership
      More than 16000 engineering workers at 45 firms mainly in
  south Germany held warning strikes lasting up to two hours
  yesterday Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH and
  aerospace group MesserschmittBoelkowBlohm GmbH
      Today 28000 employees from 110 companies came out in
  warning strikes a statement from IG Metall said
      Money market dealers said that overnight call money rates
  would rise in the near future in any case and did not depend on
  a politicallyinhibited Bundesbank
      About eight billion marks were coming into the market
  tomorrow from salary payments by the federal government
      As a result some banks fell back on the Bundesbanks offer
  to mop up liquidity via the sale of threeday treasury bills
  anticipating still lower rates before the monthend
      But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customers
  was due on Monday other dealers noted If banks were short of
  liquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday rates could soar
  perhaps to the 550 pct Lombard ceiling
      Banks were well stocked up with funds having an average
  521 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first
  24 days of March well above the 507 billion requirement
