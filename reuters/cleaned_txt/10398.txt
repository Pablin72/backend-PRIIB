PORSCHE EXPECTS IMPROVEMENT IN US SALES
  Sports carmaker Dr Ing HCF
  Porsche AG ltPSHGF said it expects to post a satisfactory
  profit in 198687 with domestic volume sales seen lower but
  US Sales anticipated higher
      Managing board chairman Peter Schutz said domestic sales
  were expected to fall to 9000 in the year ending July 31 from
  11340 in 198586 US Sales should rise to more than 30000
  from 28670 last year
      Schutz made no specific profit or sales forecasts Last
  month the company said it expected net profit to fall below 70
  mln marks this year from 753 mln marks in 198586
      For sales Porsche expects its overall world volume this
  year to be above 50000 Sales last year stood at 53254
  Schutz said His expectations of a satisfactory profit were
  based on a combination of price rises and costcutting he
  added
      The expected drop in West German sales this year would be
  the result of the socalled grey market for Porsche cars he
  said When the dollar was strong against the mark many
  Porsches had been bought locally in West Germany for illegal
  export to the US
      Porsche has previously said domestic sales in the 198687
  first half fell to 3267 from 5387 in the same 198586 period
      The fact that US Sales will account for a larger
  percentage of overall sales this year than before does not pose
  problems for profit the Porsche board said
      In the last 12 months it has raised US Prices by around
  20 pct without suffering any decline in sales At the same time
  Porsche has hedged its dollardenominated business for the
  198687 business year finance director Heinz Branitzki
      Branitzki put Porsches hedging costs in 198586 at 28 mln
  marks
      In a speech to the annual meeting Schutz said thirdparty
  orders placed with Porsches engineering research centre in
  Weissach were rising and should top 100 mln marks this year for
  the first time
      Porsches net profit dropped sharply to 753 mln marks in
  198586 from 1204 mln marks in 198485
