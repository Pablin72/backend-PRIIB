BUNDESBANK SEEN STEERING STEADY MONETARY COURSE
  The Bundesbank is likely to steer a
  steady monetary course over the next few weeks and a change in
  credit policies is not expected at tomorrows regular central
  bank council meeting bank economists and dealers said
      There is no need for action Hermann Remsperger chief
  economist of Berliner Handels and Frankfurter Bank BHF said
      Others noted that exchange rates are stable after last
  months Group of Six agreement in Paris and central bank money
  stock growth is still well above the three to six pct target
  zone so a change in credit policies could be ruled out
      One money market dealer said comments by Bundesbank
  President Karl Otto Poehl at a private seminar in Duesseldorf
  two weeks ago hinting at another interest rate cut only
  indicated the Bundesbank might act if conditions changed
      Bank economists said US Pressure on West Germany to
  further ease credit policies had receded since the Paris pact
      But such demands could reemerge if West Germany failed to
  stimulate its economy enough to affect the massive US Trade
  deficit
      Remsperger said continued strong money supply growth also
  precluded a further cut in official interest rates
      Central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 75
  pct in February unchanged from the 75 pct in January
      Economists said some of the 18 members of the central bank
  council were worried about the continued overshoot in the money
  supply target and were bound to resist any moves to cut rates
  But Poehl played down the risk of inflation
      Economists said the fact that money stock growth remained
  stable last month was a success Some said it was likely to
  return to within the target range later this year
      The special factors which boosted money supply growth last
  year are disappearing one economist said
      He said some 75 pct of the money supply increase in 1986
  was caused by a sharp rise in the inflow of foreign funds
      This trend had been reversed recently and with domestic
  credit demand likely to remain at steady levels money stock
  growth was expected to narrow in the mediumterm
      These developments were increasing the Bundesbanks scope
  for a rate cut in the mediumterm economists said
      Money market dealers said period rates remained little
  changed indicating no change in credit policy was expected
      Call money rates declined to 37580 pct from 39095
  yesterday with the market well stocked with liquidity
      Dealers said call money was soft because tax payments on
  behalf of customers had been less than expected so far But
  rates were likely to tighten again as soon as the full effect
  of this months major tax payment period is felt Payments for
  the federal railways bond are also likely to burden the market
      The Bundesbank did not inject liquidity via a securities
  repurchase agreement this week but countered a tightening in
  rates on Monday by injecting funds through governmentowned
  banks
      Dealers said recent securities repurchase pacts had shown
  the Bundesbank clearly wanted call money rates stable at 380
      One dealer said If the central bank wanted lower interest
  rates it would first of all drive call money rates down
      Banks remained relatively well stocked with minimum reserve
  assets They held 529 billion marks in minimum reserves on
  Monday averaging 537 billion marks over the first 16 days of
  March A requirement of around 51 billion is expected
