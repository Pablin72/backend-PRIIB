  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd ltHWHHHK
  expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higher
  dividend for the year chairman Li Kashing said
      He did not make any specific projections for the companys
  earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of
  not less than 325 cents per share after a proposed
  fourforone stock split and a oneforfour bonus issue
      It paid total dividends of 130 dlrs per share last year
  equal to 26 cents per share adjusting for the bonus and share
  split
      Hutchison which has operations ranging from trading to
  property and container terminals earlier reported aftertax
  profits of 162 billion dlrs against 119 billion dlrs in 1985
      The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln
  dlrs partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South
  China Morning Post the leading English language newspaper
  compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year It said it
  expects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of the
  remaining shares
      Li said Hong Kongs property market remains strong while
  its economy is performing better than forecast with its largely
  exportled growth
      Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last year
  against an initial government projection of 45 pct
      But he said Hong Kongs large trade deficit with the US
  May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affect
  the British colony
      He said all of the companys major operations showed
  improved results in 1986
      Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 235 pct
  interest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd ltHKEHHK to
  ltCavendish International Holdings Ltd itself a spinoff from
  Hongkong Electric
      Under a reorganisation announced separately Hongkong
  Electric will spin off all its nonelectricity related
  activities into Cavendish which will be listed on the local
  stock exchange Hongkong Electric shareholders will receive one
  share in Cavendish for every Hongkong Electric share
      Cavendish will buy the 3482 mln Hongkong Electric shares
  from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares
      The spinoff and the sale of Hongkong Electric shares will
  give Hutchison a 53 pct stake in Cavendish
      Li said the decision to spinoff Cavendish is to relieve
  Hongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company for
  making risky investments But he denied there was pressure from
  the government for the spinoff
      He said Cavendish will have seven billion dlrs of assets
  and will be almost debt free with 340 mln dlrs of liabilites
  Its major assets are the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel property
  development and interests in Husky Oil Ltd ltHYOTO of Canada
  and Pearson Plc ltPSONL of Britain
