BAYER CONFIDENT OF POSTING GOOD 1987 RESULTS
  Chemicals group Bayer
  AG ltBAYGF said it expects to post another good result in 1987
  after raising pretax profit to a new record high in 1986
      The company said that this was despite the marks further
  strengthening against the dollar and other currencies and
  despite an increase in competitive pressure
      The further progress of our business will depend largely on
  the extent to which threats to free trade materialise and on
  the developments of exchange rates raw material and energy
  costs
      Bayer said world group pretax profit rose to 330 billion
  marks in 1986 exceeding the previous years record of 315
  billion Parent company pretax profit increased to 172
  billion from 162 billion
      The company gave no net profit figures or any indication of
  the likely 1986 dividend Bayer paid a 10mark dividend on 1985
  results up one mark from a year earlier
      Bayer said that world group operating profit declined
  slightly in 1986 against 1985 but nonoperating results showed
  a further improvement
      Bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to
  4075 billion marks from 4593 billion in 1985 reflected mainly
  the sharp fall in the dollar against the mark
      Lower prices on the raw material side had also brought
  pressure on selling prices it added
      In volume terms however 1986 sales rose slightly against
  1985 the company said without giving details
      The western Europe North America and Far East regions
  developed well in local currency but here too the translation
  of local currency sales into marks distorted the picture
  especially in the case of North America it said
      Bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in
  1986 although turnover fell 43 pct to 1677 billion marks
      Capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986
  resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs This combined
  with savings in raw material and energy costs helped offset
  falling prices and cost increases in other areas
      The rise in pretax parent company profit was due to lower
  extraordinary expenses and higher net interest income
  Plastics organic chemicals polyurethanes and coating raw
  materials all developed well it said
      Turning to the 1986 fourth quarter Bayer said that world
  group turnover fell to 967 billion marks in the last three
  months of 1986 from 1043 billion in the same 1985 period
      Parent company turnover in the fourth quarter fell 71 pct
  to 369 billion marks with domestic turnover 41 pct lower and
  foreign turnover 86 pct lower
      Exports accounted for 653 pct of turnover in the quarter
  against 664 pct in the same quarter of 1985
