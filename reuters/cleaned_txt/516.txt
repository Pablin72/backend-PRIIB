CANADA RULING ON US CORN INJURY DUE THIS WEEK
  The Canadian government is expected
  to announce later this week its final ruling whether US corn
  exports to Canada have injured Ontario corn growers US
  government and farm group representatives said
      The deadline for a final determination is March 7
      US officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in a
  similar case covering European pasta imports In that case
  Canada decided pasta imports which take about ten pct of the
  Canadian market did not injure domestic producers US corn
  exports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market
      Canada slapped a 105 dlrs per bushel duty on US corn
  imports in November 1986 but reduced the duty to 85 cts last
  month because the Canadian government said US subsidies to 
  corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated
