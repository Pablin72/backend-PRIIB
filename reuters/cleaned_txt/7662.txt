KEATING SEES LOWER AUSTRALIAN CURRENT DEFICIT
  Australian Treasurer Paul Keating said
  he expects the countrys 198687 current account deficit to be
  one billion dlrs lower than the 147 billion forecast in the
  August budget Keating told a financiers dinner that
  Februarys 750 mln dlr deficit against Januarys 123 billion
  was in the groove of the governments expectations
      We will probably bring the current account this year under
  14 billion I think which will probably be about a billion
  dollars less than we forecast in the budget Keating said I am
  sure we will see a lower current account deficit for next year
   And a fall as proportion of GDP
      Australia posted a 1382 billion dlr current account
  deficit in 198586 and Keating said the latest monthly figures
  showed an encouraging trend
      Keating said the government would maintain responsible
  economic management regardless of whether it was drawn into an
  election because it would take time to stabilise Australias
  80 billion dlr foreign debt
      We have to build the import competing sector back he said
  We are now trying to rebuild our capital structure We are
  trying to rebuild the culture of productivity and
  manufacturing
      Keating said the foundation for a transition of the economy
  had been laid with the floating of the Australian dollar and
  continued with wage restraint and deregulation
      The Government would follow with spending cuts in its
  economic statement on May 14 he said
