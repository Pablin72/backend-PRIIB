EXXON OFFICIAL URGES PLANNING FOR NEXT OIL SURGE
  World governments
  should prepare for an inevitable significant increase in the
  price of oil as nonMiddle East supplies diminish Exxon Corp
  ltXON director and senior vicepresident Donald McIvor said
      Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulk
  of world oil reserves lies in the Middle East he said in a
  speech prepared for delivery to the Australian Petroleum
  Exploration Association APEA annual conference
      It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewhere
  will not change this fact he said
      McIvor said 37 of the worlds 30000 oil fields contain
  about 35 pct of all oil ever discovered
      Only 11 of these 37 supergiant fields lie outside the
  Middle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in the
  last 20 years three of them in the Middle East he said
      He also said that since 1970 the world has been consuming
  20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at the
  rate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year
      More than half of remaining proved reserves are in the
  Middle East he said
      McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oil
  outside the Middle East because each addition contributes to a
  diversity of supply desirable for global political and economic
  stability
      It is important to enhance the likelihood of homecountry
  discoveries with measures such as nondiscriminatory and stable
  taxation and minimum regulation together with opening up of
  acreage for exploration he said
      Increasing reliance on the Middle East will also boost the
  incentive to use natural gas and synthetic sources of
  petroleum he added
