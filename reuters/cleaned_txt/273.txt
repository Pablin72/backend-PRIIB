SAUDI FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT PUT AT 35 MLN BPD
  Saudi crude oil output last month fell
  to an average of 35 mln barrels per day bpd from 38 mln bpd
  in January Gulf oil sources said
      They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Juaymah
  terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 19 mln bpd last month
  from 22 mln in January because of lower liftings by some
  customers
      But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf
  exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 25 mln bpd
  from 12 mln in the third week the sources said
      The production figures include neutral zone output but not
  sales from floating storage which are generally considered
  part of a countrys output for Opec purposes
      Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4133 mln bpd under a
  production restraint scheme approved by the 13nation group
  last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs
  a barrel
      The sources said the twofold jump in exports last week
  appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February
  entitlements before the monthend
      Last weeks high export levels appeared to show continued
  support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabias main crude
  customers the four expartners of Aramco the sources said
      The four  Exxon Corp ltXON Mobil Corp ltMOB Texaco Inc
  ltTX and Chevron Corp ltCHV  signed a longterm agreement
  last month to buy Saudi crude for 1752 dlrs a barrel
      However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabias
  ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will
  come this month when demand for petroleum products
  traditionally tapers off Spot prices have fallen in recent
  weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels
      Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday
  reiterated the kingdoms commitment to the December OPEC accord
  and said it would never sell below official prices
      The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell
  slightly in February to an average 11 mln bpd from 12 mln in
  January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export
  refineries
      They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100000 bpd
  last month compared to zero in January while throughput at
  Bahrains refinery and neutral zone production remained steady
  at around 200000 bpd each
