FEDS JOHNSON SEES INFLATION CONTROLLED
  Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman
  Manuel Johnson said inflationary pressures are under control
  and noted wage and price pressures are very moderate
      Johnson told a womens group that the US was not seeing
  the kind of cost pressures of the past
      He said the trade imbalance was a serious trouble spot and
  strong protectionist pressures if translated into policies
  could ultimately lead to higher inflation and a high interest
  rate policy by the Fed
