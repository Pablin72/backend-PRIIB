BRAZIL CANCELS OIL PURCHASE FROM SAUDI ARABIA
  Brazils stateoil company
  Petrobras cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi
  Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees
  from the Bank of Brazil a Petrobras official said
      Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference the
  Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such
  conditions after Brazils decision to halt interest payment of
  its commercial debts last month
      The shipment of 22 mln barrels represents two days of oil
  consumption in Brazil
      But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and
  decide to respect the terms of the contract then Petrobras
  will lift the order to cancel the shipment
      Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazils terms by
  Monday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere
      Petrobras has been Saudi Arabias traditional client since
  1955 If they do not accept our conditions now it will be much
  better for us because with the market prices more or less the
  same buying from Iraq and China is an advantage he said
      Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil importing
  Brazilian goods in exchange for oil but the Saudis buy nothing
  from Brazil he said
      Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industry
  workers and a twoweek stoppage by Brazilian seamen Petrobras
  oil stocks are reasonably balanced 
      Saudi Arabia is Brazils second biggest oil supplier with
  an average 115000 bpd Iraq is the main supplier with 235000
  bpd China comes third with 58000 bpd
      If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship fine I
  am sure that if they do we will be getting dozens of offers
  from elsewhere Santana added
