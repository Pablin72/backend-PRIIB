TRADE SAYS EC SUGAR TENDER HARD TO FORECAST
  Traders here and in Paris said the
  results of todays EC white sugar tender are hard to forecast
  because of plans by a group of French West German Dutch and
  Belgian operators to sell one mln tonnes of sugar into
  intervention
      London traders said bids for licences have been reported
  between 4300 and 4400 Ecus per 100 kilos and if any licences
  are granted they are likely to be towards the lower end of that
  range possibly 43304350 Ecus
      Traders in Paris said they expect maximum rebates of
  between 43 and 4350 Ecus
      Other than the Commission releasing no sugar for export
  the likely tonnage is expected to be very small the London
  traders said while the French sources declined to estimate
  volume in view of the psychological impact of the planned sales
  into intervention in protest against EC export policies
      Last week licences for 60500 tonnes were awarded at a
  maximum rebate of 43147 Ecus
