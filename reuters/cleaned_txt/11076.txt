US TRADE OFFICIAL SAYS JAPAN ACTION FOOLISH
  A high level US trade official
  said it would be foolish for Japan to strike back against the
  United States for its sanctions on Japanese semiconductor
  electronics products
      Asked by reporters if Japan was expected to retaliate
  against US exports Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce Bruce
  Smart replied That would be the height of foolishness
      In addition he doubted Japan could show enough progress in
  meeting the conditions of the agreement to avoid the actual
  imposition of the 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on April 17
      Japans 586 billion dlr trade surplus with the United
  States last year has come under fire in Congress concerned
  about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the
  record 169 billion dlrs US trade deficit in 1986
      President Reagans sanctions decision won praise today from
  the two Democratic leaders of Congress
      I think its about time Senate Democratic Leader Robert
  Byrd of West Virginia told reporters House Speaker Jim Wright
  of Texas told reporters before the opening of the House
  session It just shows we were right all along when we said
  something needs doing
      Smart testified before a Senate Labor Committee hearing
  that last Fridays US trade action would help US
  negotiations on access to Japan for US auto parts
      Since last August Smart has been leading talks to open up
  Japan to purchases of more USmade automotive parts Last
  year Japan racked up a 36 billion dlr trade surplus with the
  United States in these products
      Both countries expect to conclude the talks by August 1987
      Its amazing to me that the Japanese were surprised I
  hope it will persuade them were serious Smart said of the
  White House trade sanctions
      The United States has tried to convince Japanese car
  companies of the quality of Americanmade parts and to draw
  them away from their traditional Japanese suppliers
      All we ask is a chance We have a job to do persuading them
  we can do better than our reputation seems to be he said
      Measured per car each Americanmade car contained about
  700 dlrs in Japanese auto parts while each Japanesemade car
  contained about 26 dlrs in US auto parts Smart said
