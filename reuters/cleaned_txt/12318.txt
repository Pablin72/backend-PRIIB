MORGAN ltJPM PLACES BRAZIL LOANS ON NONACCRUAL
  JP Morgan and Co Inc parent of
  Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York said that it will place
  13 billion dlrs of medium and longterm loans to Brazil on a
  nonaccrual basis matching similar action by BankAmerica Corp
  ltBAC earlier today
      The move which follows Brazils suspension of interest
  payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt on February
  20 is expected to reduce first quarter net income by about 20
  mln dlrs of which four mln dlrs represents interest accrued
  prior to 1987 but still uncollected the bank said
      Morgan earned 2339 mln dlrs in the first quarter of 1986
      Morgan also said that based on current interest rates and
  assuming cash interest payments are not received for the rest
  of the year 1987 net income would be reduced by about 72 mln
  dlrs 1986 net income was 8725 mln dlrs
      Although US banks do not have to put loans on nonaccrual
  until they are over 90 days past due Morgan said some of the
  loans affected by the Brazil payment freeze may reach the
  90day limit during the second and third quarters
      Morgan said it assumes talks between Brazil and commercial
  bank lenders will proceed expeditiously and interest payments
  will resume at the earliest practicable date
