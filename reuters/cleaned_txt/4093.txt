TAIWAN CLAMPS NEW CONTROLS ON CURRENCY INFLOWS
  Taiwans new controls on currency
  inflows implemented today are a desperate bid to stem a flood
  of speculative money prompted by the local currency surge
  against the US Dollar local and foreign bankers said
      The central bank now has to clear remittances exceeding one
  mln US Dlrs earned from exports shipping and insurance and
  bank lending plus remittances of more than 10000 dlrs from any
  other source
      Petitioners have to show their remittances relate to
  genuine commercial transactions
      Meanwhile traders are no longer required to report all
  outward payments concerning invisible trade including freight
  insurance and royalties to the central bank
      But bankers said they believed the new controls would be
  ineffective since businessmen could split up remittances into
  smaller units or simply remit money through Taiwans
  flourishing currency black market
      The bankers said the controls announced on March 6 are a
  panic reaction to US Pressure which has intensified over the
  past week for a faster appreciation of the Taiwan dollar to
  slow the growth of Taiwans exports to the US
      The government has denied local press reports Washington is
  pressing for an exchange rate of up to 28 dlrs
      The Taiwan dollar opened four cents up today at 3470
      I dont think the central bank has a final target said an
  executive with a US Bank Other bankers and economists said
  they are wary of making any firm predictions about how far the
  Taiwan dollar will rise
      Taiwans trade surplus with the US Hit 136 billion US
  Dlrs last year against 102 billion in 1985 The surplus
  widened in the first two months of the year to 235 billion
  dlrs from 187 billion in the same period last year
      Economists estimate up to five billion dlrs in speculative
  money flowed into Taiwan in 1986
      This inflow helped boost foreign exchange reserves to more
  than 51 billion dlrs from just under 25 billion this time last
  year and provided further upward pressure on the currency
      The Taiwan dollar has appreciated by almost 15 pct against
  the US Currency since September 1985 further encouraging
  speculators
      Central bank governor Chang Chicheng said last week
  Washingtons pressure plus rising foreign exchange reserves
  meant a further strengthening in the currency is inevitable
      Many local bankers argue the only effective solution to the
  currency problem is to drop foreign exchange controls and allow
  the local dollar to find its own level
      Lifting exchange controls is the final answer but the
  central bank is not prepared to do it It simply does not want
  to take the risk said one local banker
      He said he believed the new restrictions are a temporary
  measure designed to buy time as the central bank grapples with
  the exchange rate problem
      The restrictions are a bureaucratic imposition and skirt
  around the real issue he said
      Taiwan needs a fundamental restructuring of foreign
  exchange controls said an executive with a western bank
      The controls will create more paperwork but the extra bank
  charges will not outweigh the profits of speculation said the
  manager of a European bank
      Economists criticised the controls saying they could
  antagonise Washington which is pushing for further economic
  liberalisation in Taiwan
      Instead of liberalising outflows the government has
  restricted inflows said Kate Newman an economist with Vickers
  da Costa
      A local banker who declined to be named said Its
  basically ridiculous Its a backward movement and goes against
  the governments liberalisation programme
      Taiwan last year eased some of its financial regulations to
  enable Taiwan nationals to invest in foreign government bonds
  treasury bills and certificates of deposit and to allow
  individuals to take 5000 US Dlrs in cash out of the country
  each year
