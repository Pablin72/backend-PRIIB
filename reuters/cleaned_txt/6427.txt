US REAL GNP ROSE 11 PCT IN FOURTH QUARTER
  The US Gross National Product
  after removing the impact of inflation increased at a revised
  annual rate of 11 pct in the fourth quarter the Commerce
  Department said
      That was down from an earlier preliminary 13 pct rise
  estimated a month ago and down from the 21 pct rise in the
  fourth quarter of 1985
      The final fourth quarter revision however left unchanged
  the previous estimate of a 25 pct increase in GNP for all of
  1986 over 1985
      The revised estimate for fourth quarter GNP partly
  reflected a downward revision in inventories to a total
  decrease of 285 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter the
  department said
      The revisions also indicated personal consumption spending
  decreased 22 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter after an
  increase of 396 billion dlrs in the third quarter
      Exports of goods and services rose 153 billion dlrs after
  a decline of 94 billion dlrs in the third quarter Imports
  decreased 700 mln dlrs in the final quarter in contrast to an
  increase of 209 billion dlrs in the third quarter
