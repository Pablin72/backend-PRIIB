SWEDEN REVISES DOWN JANUARYS INFLATION FIGURE
  Swedens rate of inflation during
  January has been revised downwards after a fault was made in
  calculating the figures the Central Bureau of Statistics said
      The January rise in consumer prices was 10 pct instead of
  the previously announced 13 pct the bureau said without
  explaining how the error arose
      Consumer prices in February rose 03 pct compared with 01
  pct in February last year the bureau said The total inflation
  rate so far this year is therefore 13 pct allowing for
  Januarys revised figures it added
      Yearonyear inflation rose to 34 pct in February against
  a revised 32 pct in January and a yearonyear rate of 53 pct
  in February 1986 the bureau said
      The slowdown in price rises was mainly due to a government
  imposed price freeze which came into force on February 4 the
  bureau added
