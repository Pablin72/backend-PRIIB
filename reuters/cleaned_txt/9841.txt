BANK OF SPAIN PROVIDES YEAR RECORD ASSISTANCE FUNDS
  The Bank of Spain provided 1145 billion
  pesetas in assistance funds which bankers said reflected fears
  of fresh increases in overnight rates
      The daily auction was the biggest of the year and comes
  after the previous record set last June 6 of 1240 billion
  pesetas
      A spokesman for one of Spain top five banks said higher
  overnight call money rates were expected in the short term in
  view of disappointing money supply figures for February
      The M4 money supply measured as liquid assets in public
  hands rose 167 pct last month against 81 pct in January and
  compared with this years eight pct target Money supply growth
  was 114 pct last year
      The central bank on Tuesday raised overnight rates by a
  quarter of a percentage point to 14 pct on demand for 746
  billion pesetas Rates stood at 121 pct at the start of the
  year and have been increased to drain liquidity on rising
  demand for funds The policy is proving counterproductive and
  rates will have to come down in the longterm the bank
  spokesman said in reply to Reuters enquiries
      He said higher rates were fuelling an influx of shortterm
  speculative capital from abroad
      At least 800 mln dlrs of current excess liquidity in the
  system is convertible pesetas from West Germany and other
  countries with much lower rates he said
