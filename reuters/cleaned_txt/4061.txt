  offer their collective resignation rather than end their
  13dayold national strike on managements terms

  marines occupied the ship Docemarte in Santos harbour Tuesday
  night They said seamen on the vessel were being forced to work

      The strike by 40000 seamen comes as Brazil faces a serious
  debt crisis brought on by a sharp deterioration in its trade
  balance The country needs all the foreign exchange it can get
  and shipowners have been quick to denounce seamen for the harm
  the strike is doing to exports

  Association read The seamens strike is illegal irrational
  and unpatriotic
      The seamen respond that they cannot live on their present
  salaries According to officical pay lists available in the
  unions office the basic pay for ordinary seamen is 1977
  cruzados a month while various allowances can bring their
  total pay up to 4000 cruzados a month

  a month basic pay which is brought up to 15229 cruzados with
  allowances

  received a pay increase since February 1986 and prices have
  doubled since then with the collapse of the governments

      Talks in Rio de Janeiro Wednesday involving Labour Minister
