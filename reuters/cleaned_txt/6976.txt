  The value of trade between China and
  Taiwan via Hong Kong fell 13 pct to 745 billion HK Dlrs in
  1986 from 859 billion dlrs in 1985 Hong Kongs Census and

      Taiwans exports to China through Hong Kong fell to 633
  billion dlrs last year from 769 billion in 1985 while Chinas
  exports rose to 112 billion dlrs from 904 mln dlrs
      Economists in Hong Kong told Reuters that Chinas controls
  on scarce foreign currency hurt its imports of Taiwanese
  consumer goods such as electric fans and television sets
      Herbal medicine and textiles were among Chinas chief
  exports to Taiwan
      Taiwan does not allow direct trade with China and indirect
  trade is routed mainly through Hong Kong
