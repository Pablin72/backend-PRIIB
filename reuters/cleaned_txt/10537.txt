ANALYSTS PEG US COTTON SEEDINGS 106 MLN ACRES
  US cotton farmers are likely to
  plant about 106 mln acres in the coming season based on an
  average of estimates offered by cotton market analysts gearing
  up for the US Agriculture Departments 1987 planting
  intentions report next Tuesday
      The annual report gives cotton traders their first glimpse
  of what US production might be in the 198788 season which
  begins August 1
      Trade and commission house forecasts ranged from 102 to
  109 mln acres
      On March 18 of last year the USDA reported that cotton
  farmers in 1986 intended to plant 971 mln acres
      Four months later the USDA estimated that 967 mln acres
  had been planted as of June 1 By January its estimate of 1986
  planted acreage nationwide was 1006 mln
      Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in
  1987 were spurred in part by belief that this years good
  demand and firm prices will be repeated next year Analysts
  said those factors make cotton a profitable crop
      With cotton more attractive pricewise I think there is
  going to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton
  Soybeans are dirt cheap said Lisbeth Keefe of Cargill
  Investor Services whose comments were echoed by other cotton
  market specialists
      Changes in the US cotton program also could lead to
  increased acreage analysts said
      They recalled that under the 1986 program cotton farmers
  who used part of their crop as collateral for government loans
  were not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton in
  government warehouses But under the 1987 plan the government
  will not pick up the tab for storage
      Analysts said the change will discourage some farmers from
  participating in the program which could result in more
  cotton The cotton program stipulates a mandatory setaside of
  25 pct of a farmers base acreage noted Judy Weissman of
  Shearson Lehman Brothers But farmers who elect not to
  participate in the program are free to plant all the acreage 
  they have
      Some analysts said cotton farmers in the highyielding
  Western states would be most likely to steer clear of the
  program Western acreage should be up at least 20 pct said
  one commission house analyst whose estimate was based in part
  on forecasts made by the National Cotton Council during its
  annual meeting in late January
      But others disagreed I think some Western growers have
  decided they should be in the program for security reasons
  Theres a lot of comfort in knowing youll be guaranteed the
  governments loan price of 5225 cents a lb Anyone outside the
  program is subject to the wiles of the market said Walter
  Brown market analyst for a major California cotton producer
      Some cotton specialists said their expectations for
  increased acreage might not be verified in Tuesdays planting
  intentions report Anything the USDA is announcing now is
  based on information they gathered before their cotton program
  was announced on March 20 one analyst cautioned She said
  traders will get a better idea of next years cotton output
  when the USDAs planted acreage report is released on July 9
      Brown took that opinion a step further I dont think
  planted acreage is important What counts is the abandonment
  rate the difference between acreage planted and acreage
  harvested
      Brown said the abandonment rate this year was pretty high
  at 155 pct because of weather problems in key producing
  states More normal would be about six pct he said
