TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR BATTLE IN US HOUSE
  US lawmakers are gearing up for a
  showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major
  trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the
  full House of Representatives in late April
      In a move to toughen US enforcement of trade laws a key
  House subcommittee last week approved a toneddown version of
  legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against
  foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices
      The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts
  to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn
  around last years record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit
      Generally the bills provisions toughen US enforcement
  of trade laws
      The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly on
  complaints of unfair trade practices such as dumping products
  in the United States at prices below cost of production It
  also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry
  complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence
      In writing the bill the subcommittee rejected calls for
  trade relief for specific industries such as textiles
      Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too
  many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back
  amendments to get tough with countries that violate trade
  agreements or keep out US products
      But congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade
  said the bill ties Reagans hands too much in trade disputes
  and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers
      Bill Frenzel RMI said the subcommittees bill was not
  one that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects
  but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work
  toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse
      The goal of trade legislation was to make our trade policy
  stronger without violating our international trade agreements
  he said
      In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and Means
  Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski DIL the trade
  subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced
  Reagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports
  from countries that engage in unfair trade practices
      It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if
  it would hurt the US economy
      Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was
  necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign
  into law
      Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a tough
  House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year he
  only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw
  Democratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation
      White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters late
  last week that the administration still did not like some of
  the bills provisions but he added Generally we feel very
  good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade
  legislation I think we are progressing very well
      The first battle will take place next week when the full
  House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep
  Richard Gephardt DMO to force countries like Japan South
  Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the US
      The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only
  that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United
  States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices
  but would not automatically set off retaliation
      Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from
  imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition
      AFLCIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the
  administration when he said any trade bill Reagan would sign
  would not be worth passage in Congress
      But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate by
  saying Im not trying to write legislation to please Lane
  Kirkland Im trying to write legislation that will be signed
  by the president
      Rep Ed Jenkins DGA intends to push separately a bill
  to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry an aide
  said Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year
      House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas one of the most
  influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by
  lowpriced foreign competition last week renewed his call for
  import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his
  support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import
  tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption
