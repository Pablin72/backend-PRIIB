US NAVY SAID INCREASING PRESENCE NEAR GULF
  Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger has
  ordered the US Navy to increase its presence near the Gulf in
  an effort to fulfil President Reagans pledge to keep oil
  flowing to Europe and Japan The New York Times reported
      The newspaper quoted Pentagon officials as saying the Navy
  would keep the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk on station in the
  Arabian Sea and the rest of the Indian Ocean until May three
  months longer than planned
      The Navy would then have a carrier battle group of six to
  eight warships in the area at all times rather than part of the
  time as happens now the paper said
      The paper said that last month US Intelligence sources
  said they had spotted landbased antiship missiles of a
  Chinese design known in the West as the HY2 near the Strait of
  Hormuz
      It said their purpose was seen as a signal Iran was ready
  to continue and perhaps step up the Gulf shipping war against
  Iraq
      US Carriers or battleships would sail out of range of
  those missiles but within striking distance the paper quoted
  officials as saying
      From several hundred miles at sea carriers could launch
  aircraft bombing runs or missile strikes and battleships could
  fire longrange missiles the paper said
