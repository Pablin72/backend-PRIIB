US CORPORATE FINANCE  NEW ZEALAND DLR FRNS
  Floatingrate notes denominated in a
  foreign currency a relatively new wrinkle on Wall Street will
  probably be issued infrequently because the socalled window
  of opportunity opens and closes quickly traders say
      In just two days we had as many issues As a result the
  market became glutted said one trader
      He said the window depends more on supply than on foreign
  exchange or interest rate risk at least for the moment
  Obviously currency risk is important But there is a limited
  number of investors right now for the paper he said
      On Thursday Bear Stearns and Co solemanaged a 100 mln
  New Zealand dlr offering of threeyear floatingrate notes
  issued by Ford Motor Credit Co a unit of Ford Motor Co ltF
      The initial rate for the notes will be set on April 15 and
  quarterly after that at 200 basis points below the 90day New
  Zealand bank bill rate They are noncallable for life
      This followed by a week another Bear Stearnsled offering
  of the same amount of New Zealand dollar notes for Dow Chemical
  Co ltDOW The initial rate was also to be initially set on
  April 15 and quarterly after that at 340 basis points below
  the same 90day New Zealand rate
      Because the Dow Chemical notes carried an interest rate
  floor of 17 pct the issue saw strong investor demand
  underwriters said
      But the Ford Credit notes and Fridays offering of 130 mln
  New Zealand dlrs of floatingrate notes due 1990 issued by
  General Electric Cos ltGE General Electric Credit Corp via
  PrudentialBache Securities Inc did not have such a floor
      Obviously the two firms did not want to issue floaters
  and face the risk of New Zealand rates falling sharply an
  underwriter away from the syndicates said He and others noted
  that the New Zealand 90day rate was 27 pct late last week
      An underwriter familiar with the Dow Chemical deal pointed
  out that because of the interest rate and currency swaps Dow
  did the issuer felt comfortable setting a rate floor
      Domestic offerings of foreign currency denominated date
  first surfaced in Fall 1985 By using currency and rate swaps
  companies can sell debt that pays a high interest rate in a
  foreign currency like Australian or New Zealand dollars But
  the issuers actually realize savings on borrowing costs
      I would say that every company which issued foreign
  currency debt saved some basis points when compared to
  samematurity plain vanilla US issues an analyst said
      Investors mainly institutions were attracted to the early
  issues because of the high interest rates They were willing to
  absorb foreign currency risk until mid1986 when sharp slides
  posted by the Australian and New Zealand dollars brought such
  issuance to a quick halt
      It was not until late last year after the currencies
  stabilized that companies again started issuing debt
  denominated in Australian and New Zealand dollars
      But many investors have still shied away from the debt
  remembering the mid1986 downturn of the Australian and New
  Zealand dollars analysts noted
      To attract some of those investors back to the fold
  underwriters like Bear Stearns decided to structure the foreign
  currency issues as floating rate debt sources said
      This occurred against a backdrop of uncertainty over the
  course of US interest rates for the intermediate term and
  predictions by a number of economists that Treasury yields
  would rise in the second half of the year the sources noted
      A Bear Stearns officer said more than half of the Ford
  Credit notes were sold by late Friday afternoon the second day
  of offering That is quicker than some recent fixedrate New
  Zealand dollar note issues he said
      However underwriters away from the Bear Stearns syndicate
  said the issue may have sold even faster if PrudentialBache
  did not offer the General Electric Credit notes on Friday
      They pointed out that the Ford notes were rated A1 by
  Moodys Investors and AAminus by Standard and Poors while
  the General Electric notes which had the same interest rate
  terms and were also noncallable to maturity carried
  topflight AAA ratings by both agencies
      We have sold 20 to 25 pct of the GE notes For firstday
  sales on a Friday afternoon Im happy with the results an
  officer on PrudentialBaches syndicate desk said
      Investors pay the US dollar equivalent of the foreign
  currencydenominated notes underwriters said
      Investment bankers said the next floatingrate issue of New
  Zealand or Australian dollardenominated debt is probably a few
  weeks away
      I would like to underwrite a deal a day But with the Dow
  Ford and GE offerings the marketplace has had enough for the
  time being the PrudentialBache officer admitted
      Meanwhile IDD Information Services said the 30day
  corporate visible supply fell to 329 billion dlrs last week
  from 398 billion dlrs in the previous week
