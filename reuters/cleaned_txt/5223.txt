UK MONEY MARKET OFFERED EARLY ASSISTANCE
  The Bank of England said it invited an
  early round of bill offers from discount houses after
  forecasting a shortage in the system of some 105 billion stg
      Among the main factors affecting liquidity bills maturing
  in official hands and treasury bill takeup will drain some
  107 billion stg while exchequer transactions will take out
  around 335 mln stg and bankers balances below target five mln
  stg
      Partly offseting these outflows a fall in note circulation
  will add some 355 mln stg to the system today
