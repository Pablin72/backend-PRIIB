BANK OF ENGLAND RESISTS PRESSURE FOR RATE CUT
  The Bank of England again fought against
  money and bond market pressure for a preBudget interest rate
  cut leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise
  in its tradeweighted index to a sixmonth high
      It closed at its best level since September 12 at 714 pct
  of its 1975 value on the index as foreign investors continued
  to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and
  the possibility of shortterm capital gains dealers said
      Meanwhile opinion is divided over whether the Bank can
  stop a cut before Budget Day March 17 and why it should want
  to
      The Banks latest strong signal to the market that it wants
  rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon when
  it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 1134 pct to
  relieve a money market shortage
      Theyre really making the discount houses suffer said
  Stephen Lewis economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew
  Eleven and threequarters pct is way above money market rates
      This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by
  any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges talk of which had
  inhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday so buyers came
  strongly into the pound
      The pound surged to a high of 15798808 dlrs at the London
  close up from the previous finish at 1565060 and 2890060
  marks up from 2872050
      If this pressure keeps upThere is a possibility that
  rates could drop before the Budget said Jeremy Hale economist
  at finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp
      Some gilt traders are forecasting a halfpoint cut in the
  base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow
      However analysts said the Bank of England will need to be
  convinced that the present rise is a fundamental rerating
  rather than a result of shortterm speculative gains
      There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious said
  Peter Fellner UK Economist at brokers James Capel and Co
      Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of
  a Conservative Party victory in any early general election and
  disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to
  hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback
  for bonds Fellner said
      An election could be delayed until mid1988 but most
  forecasts say it will be this year
      Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to
  oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar
      However analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set
  the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether
      The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable
  rate move one way or the other to half points here and there
      Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least
  a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is longterm
  capital coming into the London market notably from Japan
      They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet
  than the dollar given the latters recent sharp falls and
  current political upheavals in Washington
      The Bank may want to see another few points on the
  tradeweighted index before the Budget argued Lewis But by
  then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of
  England he added
      The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting
  pressure for a rate move before the budget but banking sources
  said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more
  than just marking up by foreign exchange traders
      Meanwhile analysts noted the market ignored potentially
  harmful news on the trade front todays figures showing that
  the current account deficit in 1986 was 11 billion stg
      This was above previous estimates of the current account
  deficit and compares with a surplus of 29 billion stg in 1985
      Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would
  have given the bond and currency markets a pause but that they
  were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals
      The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing
  banks divided as well as the markets Privately some bank
  officials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this
  week but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow
  If a move comes before March 17 forecasts are for a halfpoint
  cut with another half or full point about Budget day
