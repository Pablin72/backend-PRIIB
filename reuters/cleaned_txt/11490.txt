CANADAS AIRLINE PROFITS SEEN HIGHER
  Canadas airline industry shaken up by
  a recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor for
  governmentowned Air Canada has begun its first serious drive
  for profitability in 50 years industry analysts said
      Now weve got a company that can compete with Air Canada
  said Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd
  Clearly it can go headtohead in any market
      The new airline which arose from the 300mlnCanadiandlr
  takeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small but
  cashrich Pacific Western Airlines Corp was launched last week
  as Canadian Airlines International Ltd
      Canadian Airlines will have 3540 pct of the
  6billionCanadiandlr domestic market against Air Canadas
  5055 pct Wardair International Ltd is third with about nine
  pct
      Analysts believe Pacific Westerns aggressive and
  costconscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the true
  potential of the former CP Air which floundered for four
  decades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian Pacific
  Ltd
      They said CP Airs management style had been not much
  different from that of Air Canada formed 50 years ago because
  neither airline was held accountable to its owners
      Not that long ago maybe even just six months ago these
  two airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible Neither
  seemed that concerned about the bottom line said Bradley
      But with CP Air being run by Eyton it will be very
  conscious of profitability and shareholder return And Air
  Canada is on the verge of going that way he said
      CP Air always fighting for market share rather than
  profits was a perennial moneyloser analyst Wilfred Hahn of
  Bache Securities Inc said in a recent report
      Prior to its takeover in December it had accumulated
  longterm debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs From 1981 to 1985 its
  losses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs
      Air Canada widely expected to be privatized later this
  year in a public share offering lost 148 mln Canadian dlrs on
  revenues of 272 billion dlrs in 1985 It has a debt of more
  than 2 billion dlrs
      Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold to
  the public the prospect of privatization at a time of
  increased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay more
  attention to finances analysts said
      It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit in
  excess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs for 1986 However this profit
  recovery was due less to management skill than the fact that
  all Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986 analysts said
      Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year
  attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 in
  Vancouver which alone had more than 22 mln visitors
      For the next few years most analysts see threesix pct air
  traffic growth and they expect profits will come from
  costcutting and careful spending
      Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said
  institutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to their
  portfolios as a bluechip investment but warned that new
  competition makes profit growth less certain
      The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada At
  one time it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody
  elses Friend said
      Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline
  shares for at least a year
      Analysts said Air Canadas immediate concern ahead of a
  public stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes
  without setting off a political storm
      It also will be faced with an expensive but necessary
  updating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft
      Wardair preferring strong medicine now instead of later
  already has embarked on a onebillionCanadiandlr purchase of
  a dozen aircraft from Europes Airbus Industrie
      Canadian Airlines which has 81 aircraft last week ordered
  six commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it would
  soon buy as many as six widebodied aircraft from Airbus or the
  Boeing Co
      Analysts said Canadian Airlines with its newer fleet
  needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these without
  hurting profits
      Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects Canadian
  Airlines profit in 1988 will more than double last years 298
  mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western
