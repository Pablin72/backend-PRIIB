ABU DHABI TO REOPEN GULF OILFIELD HIT IN 1986 RAID
  Abu Dhabis offshore Abu alBukhoosh
  oilfield in the Gulf shut since an aerial attack last
  November will reopen when new antiaircraft defences are
  ready and this could be in the next two months oil industry
  sources said
      They said the Abu Dhabi government and Compagnie Francaise
  des Petroles Total ltTPNPA whose Total Abu alBukhoosh
  subsidiary owns 51 pct of the field have agreed on the
  reopening but that a date has not been definitely fixed
      Unidentified planes hit the field 100 miles off Abu Dhabi
  last November 25
      The raid killed eight workers and destroyed the main living
  quarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main production
  platform
      Western diplomats in the region say Iran was responsible
  but Tehran has blamed its Gulf War enemy Iraq
      Abu alBukhoosh was producing 57000 barrels per day bpd
  at the time of the attack but the sources said it would resume
  at a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff and
  the fact only four of five wellheads were now operable
      The sources said only 80 personnel can be housed in
  remaining accomodations the sources said
      Facilities being installed to protect the field include
  aircraft detection equipment antiaircraft missiles housing
  for military personnel and helicopter landing pads the sources
  said
      Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer in the United Arab
  Emirates accounting for about 800000 bpd of its total 115
  mln bpd production the sources said
      They also said Iran was working to reopen its Sassan field
  part of the same reservoir as Abu alBukhoosh and located only
  a few miles away Sassan was heavily damaged by an Iraqi air
  raid only 10 days before Abu alBukhoosh was attacked
