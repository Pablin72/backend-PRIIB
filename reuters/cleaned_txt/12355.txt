COFFEE FUTURES UNDER DLR A POUND AT SIXYEAR LOW
  Coffee futures dipped further and closed
  below one dlr a pound for the first time in six years
      Coffee for delivery in May ended at 9928 cents a pound on
  the New York Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange down 076 cent
  and the lowest price since August 1981
       Prices have fallen steadily since the International Coffee
  Organization failed in February to reach an agreement
  controlling exports by its members and pressure was renewed
  this week as the executive board of the organization met in
  London without reopening debate on its export quotas
      The executive board has limited its current discussions to
  administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday
      Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 130
  dlrs a pound in February when the organizations discussions
  aimed at reestablishing export quotas broke down
      Sandra Kaul a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson
  Lehman Brothers said supplies currently are at their high
  point for the year because most producing nations have just
  completed their harvests
      In addition she said many of those nations are faced with
  serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital
      This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to
  undertake sales despite the drop in prices she said
      Further US demand could be sluggish because winter the
  period of greatest consumption is ending Prices could fall
  another 10 to 15 cents a pound analysts said
      Gold futures retreated from modest early gains and closed
  steady while silver prices rallied on the Commodity Exchange in
  New York
      The increase in US banks prime rates prompted concern
  about renewed inflation but the strength of the US dollar
  discouraged new buying
      The market is getting mixed signals and it doesnt know
  which way to go one analyst said
      Cattle futures posted new highs on the Chicago Mercantile
  Exchange while live hogs rallied from early losses and frozen
  pork bellies finished sharply lower
      Cattle prices continued to draw support from the winter
  storm that swept the Plains states leaving animals stranded in
  snowbound fields and feed lots in miserable condition
      Live hogs were pressured early by the Agriculture
  Departments report Tuesday that producers expanded their
  breeding herds more than the market expected last quarter
  Prices recovered to keep pace with higher cash prices
      Frozen pork bellies fell sharply on the outlook for greater
  production and closed with limit losses
      Soybean futures posted sharp gains on the Chicago Board of
  Trade while corn and wheat were lower

  farmers intend to plant 569 mln acres this year down from
  615 mln planted last year
      Corn prices were pressured by the outlook for 676 mln
  acres of corn which is down from last years 767 mln acres
  but was larger than analysts expected
