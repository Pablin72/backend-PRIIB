  would be put to shareholders at a meeting scheduled for 10 AM

  requirement that Baker sell off several specialised
  subsidiaries in businesses related to oildrilling
      The Hughes board last week indicated that it might cancel
  the merger because of the Department of Justice requirement
      The board of directors of the Californiabased Baker had
  approved the merger On February 17 Baker said it had signed an
  agreement to sell one of the subsidiaries
      The companies had been given until April 22 to comply with
