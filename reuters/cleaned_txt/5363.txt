LYNG SAYS TOO LATE FOR CROP DECOUPLING THIS YEAR
  US Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng said it is too late to implement a full 092 acreage
  provision or decoupling for 1987 grain crops
      I think theres a chance well see that legislation 092
  passed but not for 1987 crops Its too late Lyng told the
  National Grain and Feed Association convention here
      Lyng added that there seems some support in Congress for
  092 and there was a good chance a pilot 092 program will be
  passed as part of a pending disaster bill
      But he indicated that it is already too late in the year to
  alter the 1987 crop program Signup for spring crops closes
  the end of this month
      Overall Lyng predicted very little change will be
  legislated in the 1985 farm bill this year
