JAPAN EXPECTED TO CUT BASE RATE FOR STATE BODIES
  Japan is expected to cut the base lending
  rate for state financial institutions to 55 pct from 62 as
  part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris
  Finance Ministry sources said
      They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund
  Bureau Law which should be approved by parliament on March 3
  abolishing the 605 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with
  the bureau
      The bureau channels funds to government financial
  institutions for public works and other official uses they
  said
      The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan
  Development Bank Peoples Finance Corp and the finance
  corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in
  tandem with longterm prime rates the sources said
      However it was impossible for them to follow the last cut
  to 58 pct from 62 pct on January 28 because the Trust Fund
  Bureau rate was legally set at 605 pct
      The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a
  marketrelated one to resolve the problem and stimulate the
  domestic economy they said
      On Tuesday the ministry allowed longterm bankers to cut
  their prime to a record low of 55 pct effective February 28
  The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors
  using the bureau the postal savings system of the Posts and
  Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of
  the Ministry of Health and Welfare the sources said
      These ministries are trying to determine which market rates
  should be considered when setting the bureaus deposit rate
  the ministry sources said
      Coupon rates on new 10year government bonds minus 01
  percentage points is the likeliest choice they added
