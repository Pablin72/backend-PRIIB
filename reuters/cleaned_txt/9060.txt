US SENATORS SEEK TO EXPAND USDA EXPORT BONUS
  Leading US farm state senators are
  seeking to insert into the Senates omnibus trade bill a
  provision that would broaden eligibility requirements under the
  US Agriculture Departments export enhancement program EEP
  to include traditional buyers of US farm products including
  the Soviet Union Senate staff said
      Under existing criteria USDA can offer EEP subsidies to
  recoup export markets lost to competing nations unfair trading
  practices
      Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy DVt
  is leading a group of farm state senators in an effort to
  broaden the criteria in such a way as to enable Moscow to be
  eligible for the subsidies sources said
      The senators  including Senate Finance Committee Chairman
  Lloyd Bentsen DTex Max Baucus DMont David Pryor
  DArk John Melcher DMont and Thad Cochran RMiss 
  also may fold into the trade bill a measure to shield pork
  producers and processors from Canadian imports
      The measure sponsored by Sen Charles Grassley RIowa
  would clarify the definition of industry in determining whether
  or not imports were causing injury to US producers
      Grassleys bill stems from a 1985 decision by the
  International Trade Commission that imports from Canada of live
  swine  but not fresh chilled and frozen pork  were harming
  US producers
      The bills proponents have argued Canada has simply
  replaced shipments of live hogs with fresh pork
