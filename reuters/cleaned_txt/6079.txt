US HOUSE TARGETING PROPOSAL SPARKS INTEREST
  A proposal by two US House
  Democrats to target government farm benefits to small and
  mediumsized farms was warmly received by Democrats on a
  House subcommittee today
      On balance this is the best new idea I have seen said
  Rep Dan Glickman DKan Chairman of the House Agriculture
  Subcommittee on Wheat Feedgrains and Soybeans This is the
  first hard constructive proposal coming out as an alternative
  to the Reagan administrations farm proposal
      The plan offered by Reps Tim Penny DMinn and Byron
  Dorgan DND would raise target prices for wheat to 500 dlrs
  per bushel and for corn to 350 dlrs Producers could receive
  deficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but not
  more than on 30000 bu of corn and 20000 bu of wheat
      The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20
  pct eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons not
  actively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits
      Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over five
  years protect family farms and eliminate government
  accumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would be
  halted
      However Rep Pat Roberts RKan said the measure would
  involve the federal government in deciding and defining who a
  family farmer is
      Roberts said the bill for example would restrict program
  payments to 500 acres of wheat production in western Kansas
      Other Republicans on the panel questioned how the bill
  would determine if a person was actively engaged in farming and
  therefore eligible for payments
