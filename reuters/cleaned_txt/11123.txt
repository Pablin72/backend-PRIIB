CANADA BANKS COULD SEE PRESSURE ON BRAZIL LOANS
  Canadas major banks will likely face
  stiff pressure to declare their Brazilian loans nonperforming
  if as expected major US banks take similar action after the
  end of their first quarter tomorrow analysts said
      American bankers said last week that slow progress in debt
  talks with Brazil increased the likelihood that US banks
  would soon declare their Brazilian loans nonperforming
      Such action would put a lot of pressure on the Canadian
  banks to do the same Levesque Beaubien Inc Torontobased bank
  analyst Donna Pulcine told Reuters
      They banks like to appear to be conservative said
  Pulcine and if a major bank puts loans on a nonperforming
  basis and the Canadian banks dont there is going to be a lot
  of pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is considering
  the loans nonperforming and another bank is not
      Wood Gundy Inc bank analyst Patricia Meredith said any
  willingness by a major Brazilian bank creditor such as Citicorp
  ltCCI to declare its Brazilian loans nonperforming rather than
  let Brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compelling
  example for other creditor banks
      In order to make that strategy work they Citicorp have
  to have the support of the other banks said Meredith
      Bank analyst Michael Walsh at First Marathon Securities Ltd
  said at least one Canadian bank which he declined to identify
  wants to put the Brazilian loans on a nonperforming basis
  and is trying to encourage the others to take that position
      Canadian banks are owed about seven billion Canadian dlrs
  by Brazil which late last month suspended interest payments on
  its 68 billion US dlr foreign bank debt
      Banks in Canada although allowed to wait up to 180 days
  before declaring loans on which they are receiving no interest
  as nonperforming usually move on such loans within 90 days
  They could therefore delay action on the Brazilian loans until
  late May which falls in Canadian banks third quarter ending
  July 31
      ltBank of Montreal Brazils largest Canadian bank
  creditor said last week it was not currently considering
  declaring its 198 billion dlrs of Brazilian loans as
  nonperforming
      I think that is just for the benefit of the public Walsh
  said of Bank of Montreals statement 
      Some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on Canadian
  banks from a move to declare the Brazilian loans
  nonperforming
      They said Brazil would likely resume interest payments by
  the banks fiscal yearend on October 31 thus allowing banks
  to recoup their lost interest income
      From what Brazil has said it is quite likely the banks
  will get the money said Meredith My outlook at this point is
  optimistic that there will be no adjustment for the fullyears
  earnings
      Meredith forecast 1987 fully diluted per share earnings of
  380 dlrs for ltRoyal Bank of Canada compared with 374 in
  1986 430 dlrs for ltBank of Montreal compared with 359 225
  dlrs for ltCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce compared with
  223  215 dlrs for ltBank of Nova Scotia compared with 194
  and 285 dlrs for ltToronto Dominion Bank against 274
      She forecast 190 dlrs for ltNational Bank of Canada
  against 330 dlrs before a two for one stock split
      Analyst Pulcine said she might lower fullyear earnings
  estimates for the banks by between two cts and 10 cts a share
  assuming a possible settlement reduced Brazils interest costs
      If the banks didnt receive anything for the rest of the
  fiscal year the impact could range from 16 cts to 70 cts a
  share But I dont see that as a likely scenario Pulcine said
      Walsh at First Marathon suggested however that the
  Brazilian debt situation was so complex that it could drag on
  beyond one full fiscal year
      He said he foresaw having to lower his 1987 fiscal earnings
  forecasts for the banks He estimated that Brazils yearly
  interest payments to Canadian banks totaled about 575 mln dlrs
  or about 10 pct of their total 1986 pretax earnings
