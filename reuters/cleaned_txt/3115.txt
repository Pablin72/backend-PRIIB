PETROCANADA TO DRILL TWO TERRA NOVA TEST WELLS
  PetroCanada Canadas
  stateowned oil company said it will drill two delineation
  wells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshore
  Newfoundland
      Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering work
  should put PetroCanada in a position to propose a development
  plan for the Terra Nova field in 1988 the company said
      Depending on time required for regulatory approvals
  construction could begin in 1989 with first oil production as
  early as 1991 PetroCanada said
      We have a high degree of confidence that the western
  portion of the Terra Nova field contains at least 11 mln
  cubic meters of recoverable oil or more than 70 mln barrels
  and that we could produce it economicly using a floating
  production system PetroCanada said
      The TerraNova field lying 350 kilometers east of St
  Johns and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field was
  discovered by PetroCanada in 1984
      Weve had encouraging results from the eastern portion of
  the field and we hope this summers drilling will prove up
  additional reserves there the company said
      PetroCanada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercial
  prospect and the company wants to move some of those resources
  towards development so it can start generating a return on
  investments PetroCanada said
      PetroCanada which will act as operator of the two wells
  has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block of
  the Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the fields East
  Flank block a company spokesman said later Other field
  participants include Canterra Energy Ltd Mobil Oil Canada Ltd
  Gulf Canada Resources Inc ICG Resources Ltd Trillium
  Exploration Corp and general partnership PAREX
      PetroCanada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova fields
  Graven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil
  company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from PetroCanadas Calgary
  office
      Combined reserves for Graven Block and the fields East
  Flank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels
  he added
      PetroCanada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrs
  to bring the field to production by about 1991 and the
  development budget could double if the company builds a
  production system combining both blocks in the field he said
      PetroCanada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven block
  would produce between 25000 and 26000 barrels average daily
  production with a production system that would have maximum
  capacity of 40000 bpd company spokesman Foulkes said in
  answer to a query
      The company estimates a production system combining both
  Graven and East Flank blocks in the Terra Nova field could
  produce about 45000 bpd average daily production he said
