CANADA CORN DECISION UNJUSTIFIED  YEUTTER
  US trade representative Clayton
  Yeutter said Canadas finding announced today that US corn
  imports injure Canadian farmers is totally unjustified
      US corn exports to Canada are so small that it is
  inconceivable that they injure Canadian corn farmers by any
  reasonable measure Yeutter said in a statement
      He said if other countries follow Canadas lead it could
  result in a rash of protectionist actions throughout the
  world French corn growers have recently indicated they will
  challenge US corn gluten feed shipments to Europe
      Yeutter said the US will examine the Canadian decision
  closely and if the US believes the decision was not based on
  facts will carefully evaluate appropriate responses Yeutter
  did not say what steps the US may take in response
