US COULD COMPLAIN TO GATT ON CANADA CORN DUTY
  US Trade Representative Clayton
  Yeutter suggested the US could file a formal complaint with
  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT challenging
  Canadas decision to impose duties on US corn imports
      Asked about the Canadian government decision to apply a
  duty of 849 cents per bushel on US corn shipments Yeutter
  said the US could file a formal complaint with GATT under the
  dispute settlement procedures of the subsidies code
      Other US options would be to appeal the decision in
  Canadian courts or to retaliate against Canadian goods a
  lowerlevel US trade official said However retaliation is
  an unlikely step at least initially that official said No
  decision on US action is expected at least until after
  documents on the ruling are received here later this week
