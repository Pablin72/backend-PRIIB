IEA SAYS OPEC FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT 161 MLN BPD
  OPEC produced an average 161 mln barrels
  per day bpd of crude oil in February down from 165 mln the
  previous month and an overall 173 mln bpd in fourth quarter
  1986 the International Energy Agency said
      A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production
  quotas set at their last conference in December but liftings
  were reduced from several countries it said in its latest
  monthly oil market report
      These cutbacks were due in part to buyer resistance to
  fixed prices introduced from February 1 particularly for
  fixed volumes over an extended period
      It gave this breakdown for OPEC crude output in mln bpd

      The IEA said while Saudi production stayed below its quota
  of 4133 mln bpd actual sales might exceed output due to
  Norbec stock disposals Contracts for Saudi crude have been
  signed but it is understood they have much leeway in required
  liftings
      The report said the reduction in Iraqi air attacks on
  Iranian export facilities allowed Irans output to reach 22
  mln bpd in January but buyer resistance to fixed prices
  apparently cut February production
      It said Iraqi exports are about 10 mln bpd through the
  Turkish pipeline 0102 mln by truck through Jordan and
  0203 mln via the Saudi pipeline to Yanbu Internal
  consumption is some 03 mln bpd
      The IEA estimated total noncommunist world oil supply in
  February at 450 mln bpd down from 454 mln in January and
  470 mln in the fourth quarter
      The February world supply figure is made up of 161 mln bpd
  OPEC crude production 14 mln bpd OPEC natural gas liquids
  ngls 166 mln bpd OECD crude and ngls 83 mln bpd other
  developing countries crude and ngls net trade of 11 mln bpd
  with centrally planned economies 05 mln bpd of
  nonconventional crudes such as tar sands and oil from coal
  and 10 mln bpd from processiing gains
      Within the OECD preliminary Norwegian data show record
  106 mln bpd output in January with lower production expected
  in February in accordance with government curtailments of
  approximately 80000 bpd announced in support of OPEC
