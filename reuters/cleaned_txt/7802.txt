GATT TO DEBATE US CHARGES OF AIRBUS SUBSIDIES
  The US Will pursue its complaint that
  European governments unfairly subsidise the Airbus Industrie
  aircraft consortium in proceedings at the GATT civil aircraft
  committee a GATT spokesman said today
      The US Presented its case for the first time to the
  aircraft committee of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
  Trade GATT during a special twoday session ending today
  GATT rules cover some 80 pct of world commerce
      The 20member committee agreed to open debate on the US
  Complaint starting with informal consultations and then
  holding a special session in July trade officials said
      The tension has eased the permanent trade ambassador of
  the 12member European Community Tran Van Thinh told reporters
  The US Has decided to go through proper channels
      US Trade officials again made clear their anger over what
  they call unfair government support for Airbus voiced during a
  visit to European capitals in February
      In a letter calling for the special committee meeting
  Washington charged France West Germany the UK Spain and
  the EC Commission with unfair practices on behalf of Airbus
      The US Charges that the Europeans are violating rules
  laid down in the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft
      Washington presented its reading of rules on inducement to
  purchase aircraft and support for development of airlines
  during the special session and asked the committee to confirm
  its view
      Official sources in the delegations said the US Views
  would be considered during the informal consultations but the
  Europeans would also be free to bring up any complaints against
  American civil aircraft practices
      Some delegates said the US Position appeared to give such
  broad interpretation to the rules as to suggest that the civil
  aircraft accord needed renegotiating All these matters would
  be considered during the informal meetings
