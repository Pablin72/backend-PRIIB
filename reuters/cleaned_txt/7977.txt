      The group Cyacq Acquisition Corp also said it extended
  the offer until April three from March 20
      The group said it added several conditions to its offer
  including receipt of all nonpublic information about Cyclops
  that was provided to ltDixons Group PLC in connection with
  Dixons competing tender offer for Cyclops
      Cyacqs sweetened offer totaling about 398 mln dlrs tops
  Dixons offer of 9225 dlrs a share or about 388 mln dlrs
      On Wednesday Dixon said it had bought 54 pct of Cyclops
  43 mln shares outstanding boosting its stake in the company
  to 56 pct
      Earlier today however the Securities and Exchange
  Commisssion ordered Dixons to extended its tender offer until
  March 24
      Cyacq said it hopes Cyclops shareholders will withdraw
  previously tendered shares from Dixons tender offer to take
  advantage of Cyacqs higher offer
      The SECs order came after Cyacq filed suit to block Dixons
  from taking control of Cyclops and to force an extension of
  Dixons tender offer
      A Cyclops spokeswoman said the company had no immediate
  comment on the sweetened bid from Cyacq
      Cyacq said its new offer is also subject to Cyclops
  rescinding any agreements with Dixons under which the
  UKbased firm would receive breakup fees or expenses from
  Cyclops or could buy Cyclops common stock from the
  Pittsburghbased company
