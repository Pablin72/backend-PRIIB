JAPANESE SEEN LIGHTENING US BOND HOLDINGS
  The dollars tumble to a record low of
  14470 yen in Tokyo today motivated some major Japanese
  investors to lighten their US Bond inventory further and is
  expected to spur diversification into investment assets
  including foreign and domestic shares dealers said
      The key US 712 pct Treasury bond due 2016 fell to a low
  of 960812 in early Tokyo trade against the 980506 New York
  finish then recovered to 962022
      Some trust bank pension fund acccounts and investment
  trusts were seen selling several hundred million dollars on the
  foreign exchange market here today accentuating the units
  tumble securities house dealers said
      They seem undecided on what to do with the fresh yen cash
  positions resulting from their dollar sales today and are
  sidelined until the currency market stabilises and the interest
  rates outlook clarifies a Nikko Securities Co Ltd currency
  trader said
      The dollars plunge and low yields on US Bonds will
  further promote diversification into other foreign investments
  as well as call back funds into the domestic bond and stock
  markets from overseas bond markets securities bond managers
  said
      They said major Japanese investors in the past two years
  are estimated to have held 50 to 80 pct of their foreign
  portfolios in US Bonds but many have lightened their US
  Bond inventory to as low as 40 pct
      Since late last year Japanese investors seeking
  substantial liquidity and attractive yields have used fresh
  funds to buy mark and Canadian dollar bonds and after the
  Paris currency pact actively bought French franc bonds and
  gilts while gradually lightening US Bond inventories the
  managers said
      Dealers said funds tied up in foreign assets had flowed
  into local bond and stock markets as well
      The yield of the key 51 pct 89th bond dropped to a record
  low of 4080 pct today from the 4140 Saturday finish and
  compared with 425 pct on threemonth certificates of deposit
      The key bond has fluctuated less than five basis points for
  more than a month here suggesting most dealers could not
  satisfy their needs for capital gains dealers said
      A market survey by Reuters showed some active accounts in
  US Treasuries are currently dealing on Tokyos stock market
  The stock markets bullishness late last week was partly due to
  funds transferred from US Treasuries dealers said
      Japanese net purchases of foreign securities in the first
  half of March fell an estimated one billion dlrs compared with
  average monthly net purchases of 77 billion for the whole of
  1986 Finance Ministry sources said
      The steep fall is due to Japanese investors cool attitude
  towards US Bonds which had amounted to more than 80 pct of
  total foreign securities purchased securities houses managers
  said
      Foreign stock buying in March is expected to exceed the
  record high of 15 billion dlrs seen in December they said
      Diversification of foreign portfolios is underway and we
  have bought bonds in currencies such as marks the Canadian
  dollar the ECU and French franc a fund manager at ltYasuda
