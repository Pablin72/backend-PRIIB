ECONOMISTS SEE SLUGGISH JAPANESE ECONOMY AHEAD
  The Japanese economy will remain sluggish
  in the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for
  12 years in 1986 private economists said
      Consumer spending a main driving force of domestic demand
  was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and
  business investment would help sustain the economy this year
  the economists said
      They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agency
  report today that private spending fell 07 pct in the OctDec
  quarter for the first time in 12 years
      The report said Japans gross national product rose a real
  08 pct in OctDec after a revised 07 pct increase in the
  previous quarter
      It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 25 pct down from
  47 pct in 1985 Agency officials said this was the worst
  performance since 1974 when GNP contracted 14 pct in the wake
  of the first oil crisis
      They expressed concern about the 07 pct decline in
  consumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was
  only temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had
  depressed retail sales
      But most private economists disagreed and said consumers
  were likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw
  their real income level off
      Sure consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or
  heating apparatus because of the warm winter this year but
  they have done so because they have become even more uneasy
  about their future pay rises said Shoji Saito general manager
  of Mitsui Banks economic research division
      He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of
   falling employment in many industries particularly those hit
  hard by the yens rise
      Masao Suzaki senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo said
  weakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor
  Without brisk consumer spending Japan can hardly achieve
  domestically generated economic growth as the government has
  put a lid on fiscal measures he said
      Other economists said the 08 pct growth registered in
  OctDec may have been inflated by special factors including
  exceptionally heavy spending in the public sector Johsen
  Takahashi chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute
  said the 144 pct increase in public sector spending in OctDec
  resulted from an issue of gold coins
      This is just a oneshot spending and we cant expect that
  high level of publicsector consumption in the following
  quarter Takahashi said Agency officials said public spending
  would have risen 11 pct in OctDec without the issue which
  marked 60 years of Emperor Hirohitos reign
      Takahashi said the economy might contract in the current
  quarter given the lack of additional significant government
  spending and sluggish consumer spending
      Saito said the most effective government action would be
  income tax cuts and the postponement beyond next January of a
  proposed controversial sales tax
