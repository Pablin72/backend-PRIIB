USSOVIET GRAIN ACCORD QUESTIONED BY LYNG
  US Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng said he was not sure a longterm USSoviet grain
  agreement would be worth extending when it expires next year
      It hasnt been worth much in the last two yearsThey
  havent lived up to the agreement as I see it Lyng said in an
  interview with Reuters
      It would be my thought that its not worth any effort to
  work out an agreement with someone who wants the agreement to
  be a onesided thing he said
      However Lyng said he did not want to make a definitive
  commitment one way or another at this point
      Under the accord covering 198388 the Soviets agreed to
  buy at least nine mln tonnes of US grain including four mln
  tonnes each of corn and wheat
      Moscow bought 68 mln tonnes of corn and 153000 tonnes of
  wheat during the third agreement year which ended last
  September and this year has bought one mln tonnes of corn
      Lyng said he had no knowledge of how much US grain Moscow
  would buy this year
      Ive seen people making comments on that and I dont know
  how they know unless they talk to the Soviets he said I have
  no knowledge and I really dont think anyone other than the
  Soviets have any knowledge
      Lyng said he thought the Soviets bought US corn last
  month because they needed it and because the price was right
      Our corn has been pretty reasonably priced And I think
  theyve always found that our corn was good he said
