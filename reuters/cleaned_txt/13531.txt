NO INTERVENTION DOLLAR FIXED AT 18218 MARKS
  The Bundesbank did not intervene as
  the dollar was fixed lower at 18218 marks after 18243
  yesterday dealers said
      Dealers said dollar trading was very quiet over the
  European morning with operators made wary by todays meeting
  of the Group of Five finance ministers and central bank chiefs
  ahead of the full IMFWorld Bank session in Washington
      It was undermined by remarks from US Council of Economic
  Advisers Chairman Beryl Sprinkel who told Iowa bankers the US
  Had no objective regarding the value of the dollar
      Sprinkel also called the reference to stabilizing exchange
  rates at about current levels made at the Paris meeting on
  February 22 a vague statement casting doubt on operators
  assumptions that a secret target level had been set
      Sprinkel added that if West Germany and Japan made progress
  to stimulate their economies as the Paris agreement envisaged
  there would not be the necessity of significant declines in the
  dollar
      One dealer for a USbased bank noted the dollar tended
  easier after the remarks They were obviously regarded as being
  negative And if the market starts regarding anything that
  comes out negatively then it means that the underlying
  sentiment is negative he said
      Some early selling pressure softened the dollars
  undertone
      Most operators overlooked intervention by the Bank of Japan
  to support the dollar against selling in favour of the yen by
  institutional investors and overseas operators dealers said
      After the strong focus on the dollaryen rate in recent
  weeks up to the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31
  interest and activity was likely to switch dealers said
      We can start to look at a point in time where the interest
  shifts away from dollaryen and more into dollarmark and the
  other European currencies the US Bank dealer said
      Despite the softer undertone traders would remain wary of
  taking significant new positions during the Washington
  meetings dealers said Aside from the G5 session today
  Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl is due to meet the German
  Affairs group on international monetary issues later
      The mark gained some strength from news the Bundesbank set
  a new securities repurchase tender to add money market
  liquidity at a fixed 380 pct unchanged from those over the
  last several weeks Some expectation had been growing that it
  might cut the rate or move to a minimum interest rate tender
  signalling a desire for a slight easing in credit policy
      Bundesbank central bank council member Lothar Mueller said
  the Bundesbank had not given up its focus on money supply A
  monetary policy which took into account exchange rates and
  capital flows could not be confused with an exchangerate
  oriented policy he said contradicting some growing sentiment
      Sterling eased a touch to 2950 marks at the fixing from
  2957 The yens unabated strength despite the intervention
  brought it up to 12555 marks per 100 from yesterdays 12480
      The Swiss franc rose to a fix of 120515 marks per 100 from
  120180 The French franc eased to 30055 marks per 100 after
  30060 Belgian franc was little changed at 4829 marks per
  100
