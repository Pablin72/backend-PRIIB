FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN AUSTRALIA JUMPS IN LAST QTR
  The net inflow of foreign investment
  into Australia jumped to 73 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter
  of 1986 from 432 billion in the third quarter and 455 billion
  a year earlier the Statistics Bureau said
      The Bureau attributed the increase to a turnaround of 208
  billion dlrs in official sector transactions and a 109 billion
  turnaround in direct investment
      The turnaround in official transactions to a 152 billion
  inflow from a 555 mln outflow in the third quarter against a
  520 mln inflow a year earlier was largely on account of
  government foreign currency borrowings it said
      Direct investment recorded a turnaround to a 104 billion
  dlr inflow in the fourth quarter from a 57 mln withdrawal in
  the third quarter against a 546 mln inflow in the fourth
  quarter of 1985 the Bureau said
      It said the major part of the turnaround reflected an
  injection of funds estimated at around 700 mln dlrs
  associated with the previously reported restructuring of the
  Australian operations of General Motors Corp ltGM
      GM used the funds to pay out or take over certain
  Australian liabilities of its local unit ltGeneral
  MotorsHoldens Ltd it said
      However net borrowings remained the major part of total
  inflow accounting for 616 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter
  against 388 billion in the third quarter and 403 billion a
  year earlier the Bureau said
      Net official borrowings comprised 152 billion dlrs against
  a net outflow of 548 mln in the third quarter and a 516 mln
  inflow a year earlier
      Total private and semipublic authority net borrowings rose
  to 464 billion dlrs from 442 billion in the third quarter and
  351 billion a year earlier
