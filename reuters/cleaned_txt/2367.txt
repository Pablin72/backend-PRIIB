HOUSE 092 FARM PROPOSAL SEEN SPARKING DEBATE
  A House Agriculture Committee meeting
  later today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a
  debate between lawmakers who want to expand the 092 or
  decoupling provision to cover feedgrains and those who
  oppose 092 or want it severely limited Congressional sources
  said
      The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a oneyear
  092 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter
  wheat crop The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and
  still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments
      The administration has strongly urged that the bill be
  expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year
      It is difficult to tell in what form the 092 provision
  will emerge from the committee the sources said
      Proponents of an expansion of 092 maintain there are large
  estimated cost savings of such a bill  ranging from estimates
  by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs
      Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this
  time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of
  the bill committee staffers said
      The 092 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST A
  conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting and
  staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week
      Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an
  expanded 092 program since spring planting in many areas of
  the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup
  for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30
      Farmers are now making their planting decisions so
  something has to be done quickly if a 092 program is to be
  implemented an Agriculture Department source said
      An expansion of 092 to feedgrains was opposed in last
  weeks subcommittee hearing on the bill with subcommittee
  chairman Dan Glickman DKan saying that more study of the
  consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was
  necessary
      Major commodity groups including the National Corn
  Growers the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemens
  Association have voiced strong opposition to 092
      But proponents of an expanded 092 argue that the bill
  currently is not equitable for all grains producers so it
  should be extended to other crops
      There will be difficulty in limiting 092 to wheat said
  Gene Moos aide to house majority leader Tom Foley DWash
      Projected cost savings in the current atmosphere of try to
  decrease farm expenditures would also be hard to ignore in the
  debate to expand the 092 application Moos said
      Rep Charles Stenholm DTex may be planning to introduce
  a bill to restrict 092 to only 1987 crop wheat with the
  argument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major
  changes in the farm bill
      Stenholms bill is not a rejection of 092 only of the
  timing a congressional staff member said
      Rep Arland Stangeland RMinn is reported to have an
  amendment to expand the 092 provision to 1987 and 1988
  feedgrains
