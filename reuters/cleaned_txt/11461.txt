USJAPAN NOT IN TRADE WAR YEUTTER SAYS
  The United States and Japan are not
  involved in a trade war despite US sanctions announced last
  week against Japanese semiconductors US Trade Representative
  Clayton Yeutter said
      In my judgement were not even close to a trade war
  Yeutter told a House Agriculture Committee hearing
      Yeutter said if Japan takes action to honor its agreement
  with the US on semiconductor trade Then the retaliatory
  response will last a relatively short period
      Yeutter said Japan must stop dumping chips in third
  countries and buy more American computer chips
