US CORN ACREAGE SEEN NEAR RECORD LOW
  US corn acreage this year is 
  likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed
  acreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as one
  of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty
  years Agriculture Department officials said
      USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31
  Agriculture Department analysts said next weeks figures will
  likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres
  down 22 pct from last years plantings of 833 mln acres
      Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings US corn
  production will also decrease significantly Analysts said 1987
  corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to
  around seven billion bushels
      Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains
  program along with 19 mln acres enrolled in the conservation
  program will cause acreage to plummet Department feedgrain
  analysts said
      Theres no question that there will be a sharp decrease in
  corn acreage one said Its difficult for any farmer to not
  go along with the program this year
      Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but
  at a much slower rate of around four pct USDA analysts said
      Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below they
  said compared to last years level of 615 mln acres
      If analysts unofficial estimates prove correct then the
  drop in us corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when
  farmers idled 22 mln acres in the PaymentInKind program
      Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983 A
  severe drought that summer in major producing states caused
  yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 42
  billion bushels
      Given normal weather conditions this year USDA analysts
  said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion
  bushels down from last years crop of 83 billion bushels
      This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant
  reduction in production an analyst said
      A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual US
  corn usage so surplus stocks while not decreasing would not
  increase significantly a specialist said
      High producing corn belt states are expected to show the
  greatest acreage reductions based upon historical
  participation in government programs analysts said
      In contrast soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most
  in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western
  corn belt a USDA soybean analyst said
      Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge
  he said Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in
  higherproducing delta areas
      Soybean production could drop fractionally from last years
  20 billion bushels to 18 to 19 billion he said
      US soybean acreage after soaring to 714 mln acres in
  1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that has
  steadily declined in the 1980s
      US corn acreage with the exception of 1983 has been in
  the low to mid 80mln acre range for the past 10 years The
  highest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has
  kept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln
  acres and obtained average yields of 265 bushels per acre
      Last year US farmers obtained record corn yields
  averaging 1193 bushels per acre
      We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion
  bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so an analyst said
      Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as
  long as government program provisions remain the same analysts
  said
      Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to
  set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible
  for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15
  pct of their acreage
      To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres we would have to
  provide more incentives an analyst said
