  Tonka Corp said it expects
  results for its fiscal first quarter to end April four to
  decline from the record earnings of 38 mln dlrs or 57 cts a
  share and revenues of 532 mln dlrs
      The toy manufacturer attributed its anticipated lower
  financial results to an an expected moderate decline in
  shipments of its Pound Puppies product line
      Tonka also said it expects revenues and earnings to remain
  lower through the 1987 first half compared with 1986 record
  results of 1254 mln dlrs in revenues and 103 mln dlrs in net
  earnings or 147 dlrs a share
      The company said its level of shipments is good despite a
  conservative buying pattern on the part of retailers industry
  wide Tonkas first quarter shipments will be down somewhat
  from 1986 record levels and gross profit margins will be down
  slightly from a year ago it said
      Second half sales are expected to be stronger based on a
  return to a more traditional seasonal shipping pattern in which
  retailers order and stock conservatively early in the year and
  time large shipments for the second half it said
      Tonka said that while the pace of order writing is trailing
  last years bookings are very good for orders on several of
  its new product introductions for 1987
