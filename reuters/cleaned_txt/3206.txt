JAPANESE CRUSHERS BUY CANADIAN RAPESEED
  Japanese crushers bought 5000 to 7000
  tonnes of Canadian rapeseed in export business over the weekend
  for April shipment trade sources said
      Japanese crushers continue to concentrate on rapeseed
  purchases since it converts to a higher percentage of oil than
  other oilseeds they said A glut of feed meals makes other
  oilseeds such as soybeans less desirable because they would
  add to already large meal stocks
