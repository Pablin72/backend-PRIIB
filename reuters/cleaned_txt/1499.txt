BALDRIGE CONCERNED ABOUT KOREANTAIWAN DEFICITS
  Secretary of Commerce Malcolm
  Baldrige expressed concern about the continuing US trade
  deficits with South Korea and Taiwan and said that without an
  adjustment in exchange rates there is little likelihood of
  improvement
      Speaking to the Presidents Export Council an industry
  advisory group Baldrige said the trade deficit issue was under
  discussion with those countries
      I feel that unless we see an exchange rate adjustment we
  probably wont be able to see much of a change in the large
  surplus that Taiwan in particular has with us he said
      In a wideranging discussion on US trade matters
  Baldrige also repeated US concern about an attempted takeover
  by Japans Fujitsu company of Fairchild Computer
      He said that the Japanese were resisting allowing US
  companies into the giant computer business while at the same
  time attempting to acquire control of a US company that does
  major computer business in the US market
      Lastly Baldrige said that the United States was hopeful
  that it could complete a free market agreement with Canada by
  the autumn but said major issues including acid rain
  remained unresolved
