NORANDA MINE SEEN BELOW FULL OUTPUT FOR MONTHS
  Noranda Inc said production
  will remain shut down at its firedamaged copper mine here
  until it can completely examine the mine
      If it decides to keep the mine open it would take four or
  five months before it could resume full production
      Company spokesman Dale Coffin said the investigation could
  take from a few days to several weeks but would not be more
  specific
      Noranda said when it resumes production it plans to operate
  the mine at about onethird of the normal 72000 tonnes annual
  finished capacity
      The fire which started Wednesday and burned itself out
  late yesterday weakened part of the mines support structure
  Coffin said
      One miner was killed and 56 others were trapped underground
  for about 24 hours before being brought safely out
