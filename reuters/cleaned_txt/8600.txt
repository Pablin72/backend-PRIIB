SHELL AUSTRALIA REPORTS 4579 MLN DLR 1986 PROFIT
  Royal DutchShell Group ltRDAMS unit
  ltShell Australia Ltd said its net profit fell to 4579 mln
  dlrs in 1986 from 6676 mln in 1985
      Revenue fell to 455 billion dlrs from 491 billion in an
  extremely competitive and overregulated environment chairman
  and chief executive Kevan Gosper said in a statement A 2625
  mln dlr annual dividend would be paid to the parent after a
  very disappointing year
      A return of 22 pct on funds employed represents a very
  meagre return  In an economy suffering from inflation of
  around 10 pct he said
      Gosper said the results reflected heavy reliance on
  downstream oil and chemicals poor coal and metal returns and
  the financial burden of the NorthWest Shelf gas project
      Duties royalties and taxes rose to 137 billion dlrs
  against 85272 mln in 1985 and Gosper urged the government to
  move quickly to lift costly and unnecessary regulation
      It is just as important for Australia to maintain a
  financially healthy technically advanced refining and
  marketing industry as it is to sustain oil exploration and
  production he said
      The Australian oil industry has the experience and the
  capacity to serve the nation and its shareholders well if the
  government would stop putting roadblocks in our way he said
      Shell invested 500 mln dlrs over the past five years to
  upgrade its oil refining and marketing business but further
  investment required an appropriate rate of return he said
      Exploration and evaluation spending in 1986 fell to 1877
  mln dlrs from 2635 mln while investment in property and plant
  rose to 37425 mln from 35394 mln a year earlier
      Gosper said oil companies would be under intense pressure
  in 1987 because of forecast slow economic growth
