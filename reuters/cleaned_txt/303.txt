INDONESIAN SOYBEAN IMPORTS FORECAST TO RISE
  Soybean imports are forecast to rise to
  425000 tonnes in 198788 OctoberSeptember from an estimated
  300000 in 198687 and 375000 in 198586 the US Embassy
  said in its annual report on Indonesias agriculture
      It said Indonesia did not achieve its goal of
  selfsufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because it
  did not meet a planned increase in area planted and because
  yields have remained below target
      Soybean meal imports are forecast to fall to around 190000
  tonnes in 198788 from 270000 tonnes in 198687 and 295000
  tonnes in 198586
      Domestic soybean production is forecast to rise steadily to
  108 mln tonnes in 198788 from 980000 in the current year and
  890000 in 198586 the report said
      Imports are forecast to fall in the current year but to
  rise in 198788 because of a new soybean crushing plant due to
  come on stream in early 1988
      China is the main supplier with a 79 pct share while the
  US Provides the rest it said
      This pattern will likely continue during 198687 since
  domestic soyfood processors prefer Chinese beans and are
  willing to pay a premium for them it said
      Area planted is expected to increase by 10 pct in both
  198687 and 198788
      Yield increases continue to be hampered by an insufficient
  supply of quality seeds along with pest and disease problems
