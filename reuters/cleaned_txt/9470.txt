US SUGAR POLICY MAY SELFDESTRUCT CONGRESSMAN
  A leading US farmstate
  Congressman Jerry Huckaby DLa warned he will press next
  year for legislation to control domestic production of
  sweeteners perhaps including corn sweeteners if the industry
  fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year
      Were moving toward a direction where we could
  selfdestruct the US sugar program Rep Huckaby chairman
  of the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar
  issues told Reuters in an interview
      Huckaby who told US sugarbeet growers earlier this year
  they must halt production increases said he will deliver the
  same message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday He also
  said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject
      Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic
  sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further
  cuts in the sugar import quota now at one mln short tons
      I think if were talking about dropping the quota
  another half mln tons lets say youre getting to the point
  where the program might not work he said
      Ideally Id like to freeze things right where we are
  said Huckaby leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress
      A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the
  current level of 65 mln tons the corn sweetener share of the
  US market staying at just over 50 pct and US sugar imports
  holding at about 12 mln tons Huckaby said
      A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made
  until 1987 output numbers are known late this year he said
      I feel like if we didnt expand production we could
  probably hold where we are indefinitely or at least through
  the 1985 farm bill without any changes in the sugar program
  Huckaby said
      However much depends on whether highfructose corn syrup
  producers continue to expand their share of the US sweetener
  market from just over 50 pct Huckaby said
      He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will
  capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in
  the US
      But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the
  production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further
  expanded the corn sweetener share then US sugar imports
  might be eliminated and US sugar output severely reduced
      Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner
  companies such as AE Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon
      This program is advantageous to the corn users They have
  some natural legitimate selfinterest in seeing that the
  program is preserved Huckaby said
      Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to
  think about how domestic output could be controlled either
  through production allocations acreage or marketing controls
      Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the
  Justice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask
  corn refiners to limit production
      I dont know if we will go this route but if we do
  theres a question in my mind at this point in time can you do
  that legally he said
      Asked if he would proceed with production controls without
  the support of corn refiners Huckaby said You build a fragile
  house if you do it that way
      Huckaby said he understands why US cane and beet farmers
  have expanded production because high sugar price support
  means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such
  as soybeans and grain
      But he said for sugar growers as a whole expansion would
  not be good policy
      Huckaby said he has tried to stress in his speeches to
  sugar industry groups that if growers continue to expand they
  may be penalized retroactively under any production control
  legislation passed next year
      Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in
  the sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration
  proposal to drastically slash the program
      The administration proposal is so drastic that I dont
  think it will get up a head of steam Huckaby said
      He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price
  support is unlikely to be approved
      Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program
  Huckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaint
  with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the
  European Communitys sugar policy He said EC policies are the
  major cause of the depressed world sugar market
