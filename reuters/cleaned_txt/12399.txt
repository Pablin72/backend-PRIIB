THAI TRADERS OPPOSE REIMPOSITION OF COFFEE QUOTAS
  Thai coffee exporters said they hoped
  the International Coffee Organisation ICO would not reimpose
  export quotas even though this may lead to a further slump in
  world prices
      Susin Suratanakaweekul president of the Thai Coffee
  Exporters Association told Reuters that Thailand obtained
  little benefit from previous ICO quotas which represented only
  about 30 pct of its total annual exports
      Thailand expects increased overall coffee export revenue if
  there are no restrictions on sales to current ICO members who
  offer higher prices than nonmembers he said
      The Customs Department said Thailand exported 21404 tonnes
  of coffee last year up from 20602 in 1985
      Thai coffee production is projected to fall to about 25000
  tonnes in the 198687 OctSept season from 28000 the
  previous year
      However a senior Commerce Ministry official said the Thai
  government supports coffee producers lobbying for reimposed
  ICO quotas which he said would help lift world prices
      Somphol Kiatpaiboon director general of the Commercial
  Economics Department said an absence of ICO quotas would
  encourage producers to rapidly release coffee on to the market
  further depressing prices
      He said Indonesia is expected to export a substantial
  amount of coffee this month without such restrictions
