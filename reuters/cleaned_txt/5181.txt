PERU BEGINS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATIONING
  Peru will put into effect Monday a foreign
  exchange rationing system for imports designed to stop a slide
  in the countrys international reserves a government decree in
  the Official Gazette said
      Under the system importers will be required to present a
  bill from the foreign seller of goods and apply for a license
  for foreign exchange The central bank will have 10 days to
  decide whether to issue the required foreign exchange
      Net international reserves now total about 800 mln dlrs
  compared to 154 billion dlrs a year ago
      The system will be effective until the end of 1988
      A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set by
  a council with members from the central bank the economy
  ministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes The
  central bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange in
  accordance with guidelines set by the council
      Perus reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade
  surplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 11 billion in
  1985 according to preliminary central bank estimates
     Total exports dropped to 250 billion dlrs last year against
  297 billion in 1985
     Imports last year rose sharply as gross domestic product
  grew by about 85 pct the highest economic growth level
  registered in 12 years Imports were about 249 billion dlrs in
  1986 against 187 billion in 1985 according to preliminary
  estimates
      The cushion of reserves allowed Peru to take a hardline
  debt stance last year and suspend most payments due on its 143
  billion dlr foreign debt
