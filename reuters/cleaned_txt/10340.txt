ITALIAN 1987 GDP GROWTH FORECAST AT THREE PCT
  Italys gross domestic product GDP will
  grow three pct in real terms this year and 27 pct in 1988
  said economic information company Data Resources Europe Inc
  DRI
      Michel Girardin DRI Europes senior economist said at a
  conference that Italian GDP growth this year will be mainly
  driven by consumption and especially investment
      Girardin said the driving force behind GDP growth next year
  will shift from domestic demand to exports as a result of
  expected depreciation of the lira against the major currencies
      Italys budget ministry said yesterday that GDP rose 27
  pct in real terms in 1986
      DRI forecast that inflation which was an average 63 pct
  in 1986 will be under five pct this year and that interest
  rates should drop two pct
      Girardin said the lira is expected to appreciate 14 pct
  against the dollar this year following last years 22 pct
  appreciation An expected German mark appreciation against the
  dollar means that the lira should lose about six pct of its
  value relative to the German currency he said
      DRI estimates that foreign demand for Italian products
  should grow by a 32 pct this year following last years 62
  pct increase
