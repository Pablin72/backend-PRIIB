US STOCK MARKET OVERREACTS TO TARIFFS  YEUTTER
  US Trade Representative Clayton
  Yeutter said the stock market overreacted to a US decision
  last week to proceed with tariffs on some Japanese computer
  products
      Speaking to reporters prior to testifying at a House
  Agriculture Committee hearing Yeutter said it is difficult to
  comprehend that a trade decision affecting only 300 mln dlrs
  in goods caused the stock market collapse yesterday
      I have a hunch a lot of other things were involved in that
  stock market fall including simple profittaking Yeutter
  said
      Yeutter said Japan would be sending a senior official from
  its trade ministry to Washington next week for talks on the
  computer chip dispute
      We will be glad to have him here but thats not going to
  affect a decision thats already been made Yeutter said
      The decision announced last week would apply higher tariffs
  on a range of Japanese products in retaliation for the alleged
  failure of Tokyo to honor an agreement with the US on
  semiconductor trade
