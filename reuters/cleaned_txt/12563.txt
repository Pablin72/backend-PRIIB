YEUTTER STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF TRADE TALKS
  US Trade Representative Clayton
  Yeutter stressed the importance of trade negotiations to open
  foreign markets rather than trade restrictions in a statement
  to the Senate Finance Committee
      In the long term we cannot repeatedly bludgeon other
  nations into opening their markets with threats of US
  restrictions Rather we must be able to negotiate credibly for
  global liberalization Yeutter said
      Yeutter did not mention the recent US trade sanctions
  against Japanese semiconductors in his testimony on the pending
  trade bill
      Yeutter said the trade bill should increase US
  competitiveness aid US trade negotiating leverage and avoid
  provoking foreign retaliation
      He urged Congress to reject provisions that would mandate
  US retaliation against foreign unfair trade practices
      Yeutter emphasized the importance of the new multilateral
  trade negotiating round and called on Congress to quickly
  approve an extension of US negotiating authority
      We want to open foreign markets and establish and enforce
  rules of international competition not foster dependence on
  protection and subsidies he said
