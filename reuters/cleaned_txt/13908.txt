US CALLS FOR GREATER GATT CHECKS ON TRADE
  The United States has appealed for
  stronger powers for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
  GATT to enforce world trade rules
      The call by US Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smith
  at a special committee meeting into the future of GATT follows
  a series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts by
  the 93nation body to promote fair trade
      Todays meeting was part of the Uruguay trade round
  launched by ministers last September The round which covers
  13 areas of trade in agriculture manufactured goods and
  services will take four years to negotiate
      Smith called for boosting GATTs links with financial
  institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World
  Bank He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers to
  ensure the success of the Uruguay Round
      The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened to
  assure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of the
  world trading system and the global economy Smith said
      Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak
  or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy
      He also also urged that member states be accountable to
  each other for their trade policies
      Smith who flies to Brussels today for talks with European
  Community EC officials told Reuters the committee wanted to
  stress GATTs importance and did not discuss specifics
      We are interested in more periodic ministerial
  involvementWhether in formal or informal meetings he said
      GATTs ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the
  12nation EC on April 15 about the USJapanese accord on
  semiconductors The EC charges the accord breached GATT trade
  rules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanese
  chips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT dispute
  panel be set up to review the agreement
      President Reagan who strongly supported the Uruguay trade
  round to promote freer trade has said Washington will impose
  tariffs against Japanese electronic goods
      He said Tokyo had not shown willingness to open its markets
  to US Exports
