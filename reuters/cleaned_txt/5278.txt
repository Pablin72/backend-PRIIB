EGYPT SOVIETS TO RENEGOTIATE ARMS DEBT TERMS
  Egypt and the Soviet Union are expected
  to sign an agreement in Moscow next week settling Cairos three
  billion dlr military debt Egyptian officials said
      One official who asked to remain anonymous told Reuters a
  draft agreement would reduce to zero from two pct future
  interest payable on the 10 yearold debt and set a 25 year
  repayment term
      Talks are due to begin in Moscow on Wednesday
      Economy Minister Youssri Mustapha who leaves for Moscow on
  Tuesday met President Hosni Mubarak and Egyptian ambassador to
  Moscow Salah Bassiouni to discuss the issue
      One official said Egypt would propose a new exchange rate
  for trade with the Soviet Union Current commerce is based on a
  rate set in the 1960s of 038 Egyptian pounds to the dollar
  which Moscow sees as unreasonable The fluctuating official
  rate is about 136 pounds to the dollar
      The officials said part of the debt would be paid in
  exports of goods such as textiles leather and furniture
      Egypt wants to settle the debt problem partly to open the
  door for new cooperation mainly in modernising Sovietbuilt
  steel aluminium and fertiliser plants under a fiveyear
  development plan ending June 30 1992
      Egypt which already imports Soviet coal wood newsprint
  and glass also wanted a debt deal to allow purchases of
  currently blocked spare parts for its ageing Soviet military
  hardware the officials said
      An estimated 65 pct of Egypts arsenal is still made up of
  Sovietsupplied equipment one official said
      Cairo stopped repaying Moscow for arms purchases in 1977
  when thenpresident Anwar Sadat broke with its longstanding
  ally and turned to the US
