BRAZIL COFFEE EXPORTS DISRUPTED BY STRIKE
  An 11dayold strike by
  Brazilian seamen is affecting coffee shipments and could lead
  to a short term supply squeeze abroad exporters said
      They could not quantify how much coffee has been delayed
  but said at least 40 pct of coffee exports are carried by
  Brazilian ships and movement of foreign vessels has also been
  disrupted by port congestion caused by the strike
      A series of labor disputes and bad weather has meant
  Brazils coffee exports have been running at an average two
  weeks behind schedule since the start of the year one source
  added
      By the end of February shipments had fallen 800000 bags
  behind registrations leaving around 24 mln bags to be shipped
  during March By March 10 only 230000 bags had been shipped
  the sources said
      Given Brazils port loading capacity of around 100000 bags
  a day even if normal operations were resumed immediately and
  not interrupted by bad weather some March registered coffee
  will inevitably be shipped during April they added
