TOTAL STILL EXPECTS 15 BILLION FRANC 1986 LOSS
  French oil group Total Cie Francaise des
  Petroles ltTPNPA is still expecting a 15 billion franc
  consolidated net loss including minority interests for 1986
  after taking account of stock losses of 75 billion francs the
  company said in a communique after a board meeting here
      In late January group president FrancoisXavier Ortoli told
  journalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollar
  had caused the stock depreciation turning a consolidated net
  profit before losses on stocks of six billion francs into a
  consolidated net loss of 15 billion francs
      Earlier today Armand Guilbaud president of Totals
  refining and distribution subsidiary Cie de
  RaffinageDistribution CRD Total France ltRAFFPA told
  journalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for the
  subsidiary before stock depreciation
      CRD made a net profit before stock depreciation and
  currency factors of 195 billion francs last year after a 116
  billion loss in 1985
      But its net loss last year taking account of that
  depreciation as well as currency fluctuations was 116 billion
  francs after a 105 billion loss in 1985
      In 1986 CRDs sales fell 57 pct to 197 mln tonnes from
  209 mln due to the growth in imports by independent
  distributors following a relaxation of regulations Guilbaud
  said
      The subsidiary is expecting to cut its workforce to 6000
  this year and 5000 in 1988 from 6800 last year under a job
  reduction scheme which will eventually save the group 600 mln
  francs he said
      Concerning business in 1987 he said that January was a
  good month but the situation deteriorated in February
