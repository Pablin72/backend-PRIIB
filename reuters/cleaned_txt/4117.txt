HUNGARIAN 1987 SUGAR BEET AREA LITTLE CHANGED
  Hungary is to grow sugar beet on
  105000 hectares of land this year compared with some 95000 in
  1986 the official MTI news agency said
      Diplomats said this reflected Hungarys policy of keeping
  the sugar beet area stable under the current fiveyear plan
  198589 and producing enough to cover only domestic demand
  despite the recent rise of world prices to 10 month highs
      Drought cut the 1986 harvest to 358 mln tonnes from 407
  mln in 1985 But a record yield of 130 kilos per tonne of beet
  kept production at 454000 tonnes with 30000 extra refined in
  Yugoslavia from Hungarian beet Output was 483000 in 1985
