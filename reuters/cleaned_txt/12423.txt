EC SUGAR TENDER SAID TO MARK NO CHANGE IN POLICY
  The maximum rebate granted at
  yesterdays European Community EC sugar tender marked no
  change in policy towards producers complaints that they are
  losing money on exports outside the EC EC commission sources
  said
      They said this was despite the fact that the commission
  accepted over 785000 tonnes of sugar into intervention
  yesterday from traders protesting that rebates are being set
  too low
      The maximum rebate at yesterdays tender was 46864 Ecus
  per 100 kilos up from 45678 Ecus the previous week
      London traders said yesterday the rebate was the largest
  ever granted The commission sources said today the increase
  was entirely explained by world market conditions The amount
  by which the rebate fell short of what producers claim is
  needed to obtain an equivalent price to that for sales into
  intervention remained at 087 Ecus per 100 kilos they said
      Operators offered a total of 854000 tonnes of sugar into
  intervention last month to protest at rebates which they said
  were too low The sources said about 706470 tonnes of French
  sugar and 79000 tonnes of German sugar had been accepted the
  remainder being rejected as of too low quality
      The sources noted the operators could withdraw their offers
  in the five week period between the acceptance of the sugar and
  payment for it
      They said they saw no sign of planned withdrawals as yet
  adding that they would expect operators to wait another week or
  two to review commission policy before making up their minds
      The sources said the commission felt entitled to offer
  rebates at slightly below the level theoretically justifiable
  in the light of its 198788 farm price package proposal to
  reduce guaranteed prices for sugar by two pct from the start of
  the new season in July
