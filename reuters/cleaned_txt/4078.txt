FRENCH 1986 CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS REVISED
  The French 1986 current account balance
  of payments surplus has been revised slightly upwards to 258
  billion francs from the 254 billion franc figure announced
  last month the Finance Ministry said
      This compares with a 15 billion deficit in 1985 and while
  it is the first surplus since 1979 is substantially lower than
  the 50 billion surplus forecast by the previous socialist
  government before they lost office in March last year
      Net longterm capital outflows rose sharply to 705 billion
  francs last year from 88 billion in 1985 largely due to a
  major program of foreign debt repayment the ministry said
      In the fourth quarter alone the unadjusted surplus rose to
  141 billion francs from 66 billion the previous quarter but
  the adjusted surplus fell to 74 billion from 91 billion
      Fourth quarter medium and longterm foreign debt repayments
  exceeded new credits by 11 billion francs
