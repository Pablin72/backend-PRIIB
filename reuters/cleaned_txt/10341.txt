TRADE SURPLUS WILL POSE ADDED PRESSURES FOR JAPAN
  Japan today announced another mammoth
  monthly trade surplus that economists said would be sure to
  intensify already mounting pressure on the country for action
      The world has every reason to be furious with Japan for not
  moving more quickly Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd economist
  Eric Rasmussen said
      The Finance Ministry said today that the trade surplus
  soared to 814 billion dlrs in February from 57 billion in
  January and 477 billion a year ago
      The current account surplus which includes trade in
  services as well as goods climbed to 738 billion dlrs last
  month from 495 billion in January and 389 billion a year ago
      After being adjusted for seasonal fluctuations the figures
  look a bit better but not much On that basis the trade
  surplus declined slightly in February to 916 billion dlrs from
  a record 958 billion in January
      In the medium term we expect this modest improvement to
  continue but the pace of progress may be too slow to ward off
  further protectionism or further yen strength said William
  Stirling economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc
      A strong yen would make Japanese goods more expensive on
  world markets while making imports into the country cheaper
      On a seasonally adjusted basis we appear to be making some
  progress on getting exports down Jardines Rasmussen said
      But imports do not seem to be picking up much because the
  Japanese economy remains sluggish he said
      Finance Ministry officials blamed last months slower
  import growth on a decline in oil imports as refiners worked
  off stocks they had built up in January
      The officials took comfort from a decline in the volume of
  exports last month after an unexpected yearonyear increase
  in January
      This means the effects of the twoyear rise of the yen
  against the US Dollar are finally beginning to have an impact
  on exports they said
      But economists warned that may not be soon enough for
  Japans trading partners
