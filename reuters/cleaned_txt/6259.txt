US CERTIFICATES TO PROVIDE WHEATCORN SUPPLIES
  From April through December 1986
  the Commodity Credit Corporation CCC issued 385 billion dlrs
  worth of generic certificates and about 18 billion had not
  been exchanged by January 1 1987 the US Agriculture
  Department said
      The department said an additional 43 billion dlrs in
  certificates has been authorized for issuance during
  JanuaryAugust 1987
      These certificates will provide ample free supplies of corn
  and wheat for the remainder of the crop year the department
  said in a summary of its Agricultural Outlook report
      Freeing of stocks through certificates is making US grain
  more competitive on world markets it said
      The department said last summer for example certificates
  were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn This helped
  increase marketable supplies so farmlevel corn prices
  averaged about two dlrs per bushel  somewhat lower than they
  would have otherwise
      The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40
  to 50 mln bushels it said
      The department said government spending on farm programs in
  fiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from
  1986s 258 billion dlrs
      During 1988 and 1989 the cost escalation of the first half
  of the 1980s will reverse If current policy remains in force
  annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last
  years record by more than eight billion dlrs it said
      The department said the Presidents budget proposals for
  19881992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24
  billion dlrs
      In 1987 foreign economic growth is expected to remain
  close to 26 pct the same as in 1986 but above the 24 pct
  average of 198086 it said
      Partially because of this improvement US export volume
  is expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven
  years the department said
