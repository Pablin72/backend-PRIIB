MELLON ltMEL SEES LARGE FIRSTQUARTER LOSS
  Mellon Bank Corp said it expects
  to report a loss for the first quarter in the range of 55 mln
  to 65 mln dlrs or 213 to 215 dlrs a share
      The company also said it intends to reduce its second
  quarter common stock dividend to 35 cts a share from 69 cts
      Mellon said it will make a provision for loan losses in the
  first quarter of 175 mln dlrs reflecting about 95 mln dlrs in
  chargeoffs and 80 mln dlrs in additions to the loanloss
  reserve
      It will also put 310 mln dlrs in Brazilian loans on a cash
  basis resulting in interest reversals of 10 mln dlrs
      In the first quarter of 1986 Mellon earned 604 mln dlrs
  or 213 dlrs a share
      Chairman David Barnes said the loan chargeoffs and
  increased provisions address four areas of concern in the
  banks wholesale lending portfolio  the energy sector
  developing countries some basic industrial companies and
  several commercial real estate businesses
      Mellon said the loan loss reserve at the end of the first
  quarter is estimated to be 575 mln dlrs or about 25 pct of
  the loan book compared with 4938 mln dlrs or 217 pct of
  total loans at the end of 1986
      Mellon said its primary capital ratio at the end of the
  first quarter will be in line with the end1986 figure of 723
  pct well in excess of regulatory guidelines
      Nonperforming loans at quarterend are estimated at 145
  billion dlrs or 65 pct of the loan portfolio compared with
  928 mln dlrs or 394 pct at the end of 1986
      Barnes noted that Mellon has a bigger involvement in
  energybased lending than many other banks Because of the lack
  of a substantial recovery in energy prices this year
  especially in natural gas prices it was felt prudent to
  increase reserves and take losses on loans in this sector
      This action relates both to loans to companies directly
  involved in energy as well as loans to real estate developers
  home builders and financial institutions in the Southwestern
  United States Barnes said
      As for LDC loans he said Mellon had removed about 80 mln
  dlrs in fully current Argentine loans from cash basis but had
  charged off about 20 mln dlrs in privatesector Mexican debt
      He said Mellon which was ordered in December to quit
  Brazil because of its refusal to renew some shortterm credit
  lines expects to participate in efforts to helpt Brazil and
  other sovereign borrowers to reschedule their debts
      Loans to basic industries were not major contributors to
  the increase in nonperforming assets or to firstquarter
  charge offs but Mellon said it remains concerned about the
  absence of a strong recovery in steel and related industries
      The increase in reserves the dividend cut and continued
  management costcutting are aimed at ensuring that Mellon has
  the financial strength to deal with current uncertainties
  Barnes said
      We cannot predict when the uncertainties that presently
  trouble us will end but we are confident we are managing them
  aggressively he added
