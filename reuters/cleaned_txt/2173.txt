NATIONAL CONVENIENCE ltNCS TO HAVE 3RD QTR LOSS
  National Convenience Stores Inc said it
  expects to report a loss for the third quarter ending March 31
  due to continued poor sales in Texas especially in Houston
      In last years third quarter National Convenience earned
  1788000 dlrs or eight cts per share including a gain of
  2883000 dlrs from the sale of 186 stores to another operator
   It said the results also included earnings from gasoline
  operations of 2500000 dlrs or 11 cts per share caused by
  unusually high gross margins on gasoline sales of 127 cts per
  gallon that were caused by rapidly falling oil prices
      National Convenience said its third quarter is usually weak
  due to winter weather
