  US tin disposals should have little
  effect on an agreement reached last weekend by tin producing
  countries to limit group exports to 96000 tonnes in the year
  started March 1 a government official said
      The agreement by the sevenmember Association of Tin
  Producing Countries ATPC aimed to cut the world surplus and
  boost prices Following the accord ATPC Chairman Subroto
  appealed to the United States to restrict its tin releases from
  its strategic stockpile
      We dont think that the US government has a large
  influence in the tin market at this stage of the game said
  Thomas ODonnell Director of International Commodities at the
  State Department Last year the United States released about
  4900 tonnes of tin to two ferroalloy firms
