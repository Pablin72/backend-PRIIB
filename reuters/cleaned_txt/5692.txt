      Director of the Banco do Brasils foreign trade department
  CACEX Roberto Fendt told reporters the upturn in February
  confirmed a rising trend in exports which totalled 153 billion
  dlrs against 126 billion in January and after excluding
  coffee and oil derivatives was only slightly below the same
  month last year
      Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mln
  in February 1986 because of lower prices he added
      Fendt said although the February results were lower than
  the average expected for the rest of the year the governments
  target of an eight billion dlr surplus for 1987 should be
  achieved This would compare with a 1986 surplus of 95 billion
  dlrs
      Exports this year are expected to total 225 billion dlrs
  and imports 145 billion he added In 1986 exports totalled
  224 billion dlrs and imports 129 billion
      Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 127 billion
  dlrs from 112 billion in February last year was in line with
  government plans to foster economic growth
      Fendt said imports were running at levels well above the
  traditional average for Brazil
      Imports in the first two months of the year excluding oil
  and wheat totalled 18 billion dlrs against 147 billion in
  the same 1986 period
      This rise reflected industrys need for equipment to raise
  production and is perfectly compatible with the governments
  program for economic growth Fendt added
