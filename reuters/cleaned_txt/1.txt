BAHIA COCOA REVIEW
  Showers continued throughout the week in
  the Bahia cocoa zone alleviating the drought since early
  January and improving prospects for the coming temporao
  although normal humidity levels have not been restored
  Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review
      The dry period means the temporao will be late this year
      Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155221 bags
  of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 593
  mln against 581 at the same stage last year Again it seems
  that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the
  arrivals figures
      Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how
  much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has
  practically come to an end With total Bahia crop estimates
  around 64 mln bags and sales standing at almost 62 mln there
  are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers
  middlemen exporters and processors
      There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit
  for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in
  obtaining Bahia superior certificates
      In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have
  sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment
      Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350
  cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos
      Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and
  only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1750 to
  1780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named
      New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with
