FEBRUARY US JOBS GAINS SHOW STRONGER ECONOMY
  Momentum in th US economy may be
  picking up given solid acrossthe board increases in the
  February US employment report economists said
      US nonfarm payroll employment rose 337000 in February
  twice what the financial markets expected This follows a
  319000 gain in January revised down from a previously
  reported 448000 increase
      Even if you look at January and February together this is
  still a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in
  the market said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation
      Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much
  larger gains in February US production and income than
  previously forecast
      The average work week rose 02 hours to 350 hours from
  348 hours in January The average manufacturing work week rose
  03 hours to 412 hours the longest factory work week since
  November 1966 the Commerce Department said
      The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very
  large increase in industrial production of between 05 and 07
  pct said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank This compares to a 04
  pct  gain in January US industrial production
      Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc
  noted that the average wage rate increased to 887 dlrs an hour
  in February from 883 dlrs in January
      Combined with the increase in hours worked this means
  well get a pretty healthy gain in personal income visavis
  the wage and salary disbursement he said
      Greenbaum said that February US personal income should
  rise at least 05 pct after being flat in January
      He said the February employment gains are consistent with
  his firms first quarter US real gross national product
  growth forecast of 37 pct
      Economists agreed that the employment data were negative
  for the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy
  and no easing in the Federal Reserves monetary policy But
  most said that the market need not fear tighter policy either
      This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider
  easing said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc  
    It gives them more room to address the dollar situation he
  said If they had to nudge policy tighter they could do so
  but its most likely theyll sit and wait
      The data have not been uniform Stone added Durable
  goods were weak in January and now employment is strong
      In January US durable goods orders dropped 75 pct
  followed by a 40 pct drop in US factory goods orders US
  retail sales fell 58 pct and the US merchandise trade gap
  widened to 148 billion dlrs
      Things just arent adding up said Steve Slifer of Lehman
  Goverment Securities Inc Consumer spending capital spending
  goverment spending and net exports data show very weak first
  quarter GNP growth of one pct he said
      The employment and production data point to a big
  inventory buildup but thats what we thought in the fourth
  quarter and we only got 13 pct GNP growth
      Manufacturing employment gained 50000 after falling 15000
  in January Economists estimated that 30000 of the gain was
  accounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery
  industries returning to work
      Even so some economists said that the manufacturing gains
  have resulted from an improving trade outlook
      Jason Benderly of Goldman Sachs and Co noted that the US
  trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports
  grew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in
  imports fell to only six pct and that it continues to improve
  in the first quarter
      Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter
  but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper
  products chemicals hightech goods and capital goods show
  that trade is improving Benderley said
      The economy is moving between extremes he said Some
  reports are going to look bad and some good but first quarter
  GNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct
      A 287000 gain in services employment comprised the greater
  part of Februarys employment gain Retail services employment
  rose 129000 in February compared to a gain of 117000 in
  January previously reported at 166000
      Construction employment rose a slim 2000 in February But
  this follows a robust 113000 gain in January revised down
  from a previously reported 142000 gain
      The US civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in
  February at 67 pct This means the jobless rate has stayed at
  67 pct for three consecutive months the lowest reading since
  March 1980 the Commerce Department noted
      The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report
  Carson said This takes away the Feds flexibility to ease
  but theres no reason to tighten Its way too early for that
