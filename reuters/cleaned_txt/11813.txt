TAIWAN SEES SHARP DECLINE IN SHIPBREAKING
  Taiwans shipbreaking industry is
  expected to decline sharply this year despite the boom in 1986
  because of keener competition from South Korea and China the
  rising Taiwan dollar and US Import curbs on steel products
  industry sources said
      Last year Taiwanese breakers demolished a record 344
  vessels totalling 369 million light displacement tons ldt
  up on 165 of 297 million ldt in 1985 Lin Chungjung a Taiwan
  Shipbreaking Industry Association TSIA spokesman told
  Reuters
      China scrapped vessels of some 11 mln ldt last year while
  South Korea demolished ships of 910000 ldt he said
      Yao Liu president of Chi Shun Hwa Steel Co a leading
  shipbreaker and steel producer in Kaohsiung told Reuters We
  expect to scrap fewer ships this year because of an expected
  decline in our steel product exports
      Lin said many breakers predicted a 20 pct decline in
  scrapping operations this year due to falling demand from the
  US Japan and Southeast Asia for Taiwanese steel
      Taiwan agreed last year to voluntarily limit its steel
  product exports to the US To 120000 tonnes in the first half
  of 1987 from about 260000 tonnes in the first half of 1986 a
  Taiwan Steel and Iron Association official said
      Yao said the rising Taiwan dollar means Taiwans steel
  exports are more expensive than South Koreas and Chinas
      The Taiwan dollar has strengthened by some 16 pct against
  the US Unit since September 1985 and some bankers and
  economists said it could appreciate to 32 to the US Dollar by
  the end of the year from 3423 today Yao said
      In comparison the won rose by about five pct and yuan
  remained stable during the same period he added
      We have lost some orders to South Korea and mainland China
  because foreign importers have switched their purchases he
  said
      Taiwans steel exports to the US Japan and Southeast
  Asia slipped to 148000 tonnes in the first two months of 1987
  from about 220000 tonnes a year earlier the Taiwan Steel and
  Iron Association official said
      He said he expected further declines in later months but
  did not give figures
