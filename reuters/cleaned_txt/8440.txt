  Iraq said today its warplnes had
  attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to
  keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends
      The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations
  broke more than a monthlong lull in Iraqi air force action
      It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad
  hailed as Irans failure to achieve victory during the Iranian
  year which ended on Saturday
      A high command communique said warplanes hit the western
  jetty at Irans Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and
  struck a supertanker nearby at the same time
      The Kharg terminal attacked about 135 times since August
  1985 was last raided in January
      The communique did not identify the supertanker but said
  columns of smoke were seen billowing from it
      In London Lloyds insurance said the 162046ton Iranian
  tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday when Iraq reported an earlier
  Gulf attack
      But there has been no independent confirmation of todays
  supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by
  Baghdad in the past 24 hours
      The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March eight
  when the Iranian tanker Khark5 was hit south of Kharg
      Iraqi warplanes also struck Irans offshore oilfields at
  Nowruz Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf some 80 km 50
  miles west of Kharg island todays communique said

  past three years Oil sources said they were not crucially
  important to Irans oil export trade

  flew 94 sorties against Iranan targets and positions at the war
  front
