  Managing Director Hugh Fletcher said he was disappointed that
  ltRada Corp Ltd had decided to sell its shares in ltNZ Forest
  Products Ltd NZFP to Australias ltAmcor Ltd
      He said in a statement that FCL had made an offer for the
  24 pct of NZFP held by Rada He said the FCL offer was better
  than Amcors because it would have been made to all NZFP
  shareholders but he gave no further details
      Amcor and NZFP said earlier today they were merging their
  pulp and paper interests in a joint partnership and were
  increasing their existing crossshareholdings
      The plan involves NZFP increasing its current holding in
  Amcor to about 20 pct from four pct Amcor will acquire Radas
  NZFP stake to add to its existing 11 pct and will seek
  statutory approval to increase its holding to 50 pct
      Rada bought its stake for 5055 mln dlrs from ltWattie
  Industries Ltd last year but it has not disclosed the price
  to be paid by Amcor
      FCL originally launched a takeover bid for NZFP late last
  year with a scrip andor cash offer at 390 dlrs a share
  valuing the company at 13 billion dlrs NZFP shares ended at
  388 dlrs today
