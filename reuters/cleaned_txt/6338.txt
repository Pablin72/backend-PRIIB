YEN USURPS GODZILLA AS JAPANS FAVOURITE HORROR
  Endaka the strong yen has usurped
  Godzilla Versus the Sea Monster as Japans favourite horror
  story
      The yens 40 pct surge against the dollar over the last two
  years has frightened foreigners with tales of the 40 dlr melon
  the 120 dlr taxi ride from the airport and rents of 15000 dlrs
  a month
      But endaka like many Japanese products is for foreign
  consumption locals and longtime foreign residents said
      Its not really that expensive I dont pay attention to
  the cost of living said Cheryl Richmond a 25yearold
  Canadian teacher of English in Tokyo
      Richmond said she earns 1635 dlrs a month by chatting 40
  hours a week in English to Japanese who hope to learn the
  language For 326 dlrs a month she rents a sunny quiet
  tworoom flat some 20 minutes by train from Shinjuku one of
  Tokyos prime business and entertainment districts and has
  managed to send home an average of 320 dlrs a month
      She spends less than 650 dlrs a day on food despite eating
  out once a day
      For lunch I buy the teishoku daily special which comes
  with soba buckwheat noodles or pork cutlet pickles miso
  soup rice and tea although she takes only coffee for
  breakfast and a sandwich for dinner
      No one argues that Tokyo is cheap but longtime residents
  see no need to spend the 2000 to 15000 dlrs a month spent by
  foreign firms to house executives in Westernstyle homes
      The companies feel otherwise They say they must pay the
  price to bring over the best people needed to back up their
  push into Japans increasingly lucrative markets
      You cant expect people to move from New York or Sydney and
  trade down Its not reasonable said a spokesman for
  International Business Machines Corp IBM which supports
  Western lifestyles for more than 350 foreigners in Tokyo
      Tokyo is the worlds most expensive city for business
  travellers a survey issued this month by Employment Conditions
  Abroad said It found that businessmen visiting Tokyo spend on
  average more than 300 dlrs a day
      While the businessmen have little choice but to come here
  many tourists especially those from Europe are opting to
  visit sunnier and cheaper climes in Southeast Asia
      The Japan Tourist Bureau estimates endaka caused an 115
  pct drop in the number of foreign visitors to Japan last year
      Those who came tried to cut back on expenses chiefly by
  curtailing shopping it said
      To help combat endaka and the slump in tourism the Tourist
  Bureau prepared a pamphlet Economical Travel in Japan
      It gives budgetsaving tips on finding mediumpriced
  business hotels and Japanesestyle inns cheap sushi and public
  baths while getting a revealing glimpse of Japanese in their
  daily lives
      Residents of Okubo House a transit hotel in Tokyos
  ShinOkubo love hotel district offer even more savvy advice
      For 980 dlrs a night Scott Perry a 23yearold budding
  English teacher from New Zealand shares an unheated
  berthsized twinroom in the Japanese flop house
      Perry has budgeted 26 to 33 dlrs a day while he looks for
  work Normally I eat teishoku for 400 yen but sometimes Ill
  splurge at Shakeys where for 550 yen you can eat unlimited
  pizza for at least two hours
      Still there are the extras that dent the budget I had to
  spend 600 yen today to dryclean my suit coat he said
