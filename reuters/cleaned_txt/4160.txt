  Sand Technology Systems Inc said it is
  considering a reverse stock split of at least onefor10 and
  expects to report a secondquarter profit compared to a loss
  last year
      The stock consolidation is something were discussing but
  its not definite Sand Technology president Jerry Shattner
  told Reuters in an interview
      A private placement recently brought the number of
  outstanding shares to 106 mln up from 971 mln shares on July
  31 1986 the fiscal yearend
      The company has always had the aura of a penny stock
  Shattner said adding that Sand plans at some time to apply
  for listing on the Montreal Stock Exchange
      Shattner said the company expects to report a profit of
  five pct or about 350000 dlrs on sales of seven mln dlrs
  for the second quarter ended January 31 Results for the third
  quarter should be about the same as the second he added
      Last year Sand lost 243064 dlrs on revenues of 7012195
  dlrs in the second quarter
      After a disastrous first quarter Sand hopes to break even
  in the current fiscal year Shattner said The company has
  scaled back its sales forecast to about 25 mln dlrs from the
  335 mln dlrs projected in December
      The rapid appreciation of the Japanese yen against US and
  Canadian dollars last year led to Sands loss of 21 mln dlrs
  or two cts per share on sales of 249 mln dlrs

  1350387 dlrs or one ct per share on sales of 3570585
  dlrs
      Shattner believes the company will post better results this
  year due to several factors
      Last year one of our biggest problems was we were buying
  products in Japanese yen We now buy some products from Hitachi
  in US dollars and the results are starting to show up in the
  second quarter he said

  accessories such as disk drives solidstate memory enhancement
  devices and printers manufactured by Hitachi Ltd ltHIT of
  Japan

  handle large databases and share them between applications
      It is also distributing a new product called Sapiens which
  is artificial intelligence computer language for use by major
  corporations
      The company has also reduced costs through some staff
  cutting and a switch to profit sharing plans for sales staff
  instead of straight commissions Shattner said
      And Sand plans to market a laser printer in the fourth
  fiscal quarter Shattner said
