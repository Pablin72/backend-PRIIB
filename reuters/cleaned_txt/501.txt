TRADERS DETAIL FRENCH CEREAL EXPORT REQUESTS
  French operators last Friday requested
  licences to export 10500 tonnes of free market maize 11950
  tonnes of free market barley and 13000 of soft wheat flour to
  nonEC countries at prefixed daily droit commun rebates
  French trade sources said
      The latest requests for the maize were for export to
  Switzerland Austria and Lichtenstein at a maximum daily rebate
  prefixed last Friday at 141 Ecus a tonne against a previous 20
  Ecu daily rebate
      The special daily rebate for maize was set in the context
  of a Commission commitment to grant this season rebates for the
  export of 500000 tonnes of French maize to nonEC countries
  in compensation for concessions to the US in the recent
  dispute over grain sales to Spain
      If the latest French requests are accepted as expected
  this will bring the total of French maize exported in this
  context to 25500 tonnes
      The Commission last Thursday granted weekly rebates for the
  sale of 15000 tonnes of free market maize to nonEC countries
      Requests for barley were for export to Switzerland Austria
  and Lichtenstein Ceuta and Melilla at an unchanged prefixed
  restitution of 125 Ecus a tonne while requests for soft wheat
  flour were for export to various nonEC countries at an
  unchanged 178 Ecus a tonne
