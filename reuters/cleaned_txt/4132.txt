JACOBS SUCHARD EXPECTS ANOTHER EXCELLENT YEAR
  Jacobs Suchard AG ltJACZZ hopes for
  another excellent year in 1987 after a 27 pct increase in 1986
  net profit Results in the first few months show it heading in
  the right direction company president Klaus Jacobs said
      The group reported 1986 net profit of 1909 mln Swiss
  francs compared with 1504 mln in 1985 and raised its dividend
  per bearer share to 160 francs from 155 francs
      Jacobs said the increase in profit which far exceeded the
  companys target of five pct real annual growth had been made
  possible by restructuring measures introduced in January 1986
  which had also made some major acquisitions possible last year
      Hermann Pohl general director in charge of economic
  affairs said the 27 pct decline in group turnover to 524
  billion francs was due to currency factors
      A 52 pct negative currency influence was partially offset
  by growth in operations and by structural changes within the
  group
      Turnover in the coffee business fell to 310 billion francs
  from 356 billion in 1985 while turnover in the chocolate
  sector rose to 214 billion francs from 182 billion The
  tonnage sold in both sectors declined due to higher prices and
  lower consumer demand especially in France and West Germany
      Jacobs Suchard increased its market share in West Germany
  to 449 pct from 399 pct in 1985 largely as a result of
  acquisitions Market share in France was little changed at 25
  pct against 253 pct
      Pohl said the groups average tax rate rose to 325 pct
  from 288 pct because of the higher profits and despite
  writeoffs on the losses of new acquisitions A further
  increase in tax levels was expected in future
      Taxes jumped 513 pct to 92 mln francs in 1986 from 61 mln
  the previous year
