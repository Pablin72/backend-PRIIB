ALLIEDLYONS SEES NO CHANGE IN HIRAM WALKER STAKE
  AlliedLyons PLC ltALLDL and Canadas
  Reichmann brothers are working well together as partners and
  currently do not plan any change in their joint ownership of
  distiller Hiram WalkerGooderham and Worts AlliedLyons
  chairman Derrick HoldenBrown said
      AlliedLyons got 51 pct control of Hiram WalkerGooderham
  last year for about 600 mln US dlrs while the Reichmanns
  ltGulf Canada Corp acquired 49 pct in an outofcourt pact
  after a hostile battle for the wine and spirits division of
  ltHiram Walker Resources Ltd
      We are getting along very well as partners  I hope
  there wont be any change but there could be HoldenBrown
  told reporters after a speech in Toronto
      He said AlliedLyons has a twoyear call option that could
  force Gulf Canada to sell its 49 pct stake to AlliedLyons and
  Gulf Canada has a twoyear put option that could obligate
  AlliedLyons to buy its 49 pct
      Both we and Gulf hope very much there will be no occasion
  for either the put or call to be exercised HoldenBrown said
      In answer to a reporters question HoldenBrown said it
  would be possible for Gulf Canada to sell off part of its 49
  pct in a public offering with AlliedLyons consent I dont
  think we would have any objection to it he added
      AlliedLyons maintains control of Hiram WalkerGooderhams
  board of directors and has total responsibility for its
  management We cannot contemplate giving up our control he
  said
      HoldenBrown would not disclose how big a profit
  contribution the distiller will make in AlliedLyons financial
  results but he said it will be substantial
      I am not able to give profit forecasts he said
      HoldenBrown said AlliedLyons was able to finance the
  Hiram WalkerGooderham acquisition with cash and borrowings
  and has no current plans for a stock issue
      He said the company is not currently negotiating any more
  acquisitions in Canada but has a team of officials evaluating
  possible purchases of wines spirits soft drinks or food
  concerns I dont think we shall be looking at the brewery
  scene which is highly concentrated already he added
      HoldenBrown said AlliedLyons plans to list its shares on
  Canadian stock exchanges possibly later this year
