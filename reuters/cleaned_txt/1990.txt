EARLY MARCH OPEC OUTPUT SEEN WELL BELOW CEILING
  OPEC crude oil output in the first few
  days of March was running at about 147 mln bpd down from a 16
  mln bpd average for February and well below the 158 mln bpd
  ceiling the group adopted in December a Reuter survey shows
      The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil
  traders industry executives and analysts in Europe the Middle
  East Africa Latin America and Asia
      They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the
  group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to
  a fixed price system which came into effect last month
      OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200000 bpd
  above the ceiling largely because of overproduction by the
  United Arab Emirates and Kuwait the figures show
      The UAE together with the much smaller producer Ecuador
  was also producing above quota in the first days of March the
  survey reveals
      But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall
  in Saudi Arabian output together with Irans inability to
  export as much as its quota allows
      Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1466 mln bpd and produced
  175 mln bpd in February and early March the figures showed
      Saudi output  excluding movements into stocks  fell to
  31 mln bpd in early March from 35 mln bpd in February
  against a 4133 mln bpd quota The Saudi figures include a
  200000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production
      Kuwait which has consistently denied quota violations was
  estimated to be pumping 14 mln bpd in February and 115 in
  early March  both figures including 200000 bpd as its share
  of Neutral Zone output  against its 948000 bpd quota
      Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some
  OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria
  both substantially under quota in February and early March
      Qatars February output was 230000 bpd and this fell to
  180000 bpd in early March compared with its 285000 bpd quota
      Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatars
  prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any
  shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers
      Nigerias early March output was about one mln bpd down
  from 114 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1238 mln bpd
      Industry sources say Nigerias customers believe its Bonny
  grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes
  from the UK North Sea
