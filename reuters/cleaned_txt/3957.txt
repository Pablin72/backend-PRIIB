ALCOA DECLINES SPECIFIC COMMENT ON OPTIONS TRADE
  Alcoa officials acknowledged the
  possibility that they may have a position in the offexchange
  aluminum options market but declined specific comment on trade
  speculation that the company is holding a large outstanding
  position
      An Alcoa Aluminum Company of America source involved in
  terminal trading for the company said We use all means
  available to manage our business so its a possibility were
  trading options
      We wont go into specifics about what were doing But
  when youre dealing in unalloyed ingot its a commodity
  business where there are a lot of tools available for hedging
  and Alcoa is using all of those tools said Al Posti Alcoas
  manager of corporate news
      Trade sources have said Alcoa is long call options equal to
  30000 to 50000 tonnes of aluminum due to mature in April and
  May However some New Yorkbased aluminium traders said they
  believe the size of Alcoas position has been exaggerated
      The possibility that Alcoa may be long call options is one
  factor indicating that supply tightness may worsen in the
  second quarter traders said
      If they decide to exercise their right to buy it would
  mean really squeezing the market one New York trader said
  noting that aluminum stocks on the London Metal Exchange were
  90500 tonnes at the end of last week
