COFFEE FUTURES AT SIXYEAR LOW UNDER 1 DLRLB
  Coffee futures dipped further today and
  closed below 1 dlr a pound for the first time in six years
      Coffee for delivery in May ended at 9928 cents a pound on
  the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange down 076 cent and the
  lowest price since August 1981
       Prices have been falling steadily since the International
  Coffee Organization failed in February to reach an agreement
  controlling exports by its members and pressure was renewed
  this week as the executive board of the organization met in
  London without reopening debate on its export quotas
      The executive board has limited its current discussions to
  administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday
      Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 130
  dlr a pound in February when the organizations discussions
  aimed at reestablishing export quotas broke down
      Sandra Kaul a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson
  Lehman Brothers said supplies currently are at their high
  point for the year because most producing nations have just
  completed their harvests
      In addition she said many of those nations are faced with
  serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital
      This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to
  undertake sales despite the drop in prices she said
      Further US demand could be sluggish because winter the
  period of greatest consumption is ending Prices could fall
  another 10 cents to 15 cnts a pound analysts said
      Gold futures retreated from modest early gains and closed
  steady while silver prices rallied on the Commodity Exchange in
  New York
      The increase in US banks prime rates prompted concern
  about renewed inflation but the strength of the US dollar
  discouraged new buying
      The market is getting mixed signals and it doesnt know
  which way to go one analyst said
