EC WHEAT RELEASE UNLIKELY TO SATISFY UK DEMAND
  The European Commissions decision to
  release an additional 300000 tonnes of British intervention
  feed wheat for the home market will provide only moderate
  relief in an increasingly tight market traders said
      Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage
  pointing out that at this weeks UK Intervention tender the
  market sought to buy 340000 tonnes but only 126000 tonnes
  were granted
      The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely to
  satisfy demand they said and keen buying competition for
  supplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm
      The release of the feed wheat followed recent strong
  representations by the UK Grain trade to the Commission
  There has been growing concern that rising internal prices
  triggered by heavy exports were creating areas of shortage in
  interior markets
      The latest EC authorisation will add 70000 tonnes at the
  April 14 tender and a further 30000 tonnes later in the month
  The remaining 200000 tonnes will be made available in May and
  June
      News of the release produced an early downward reaction in
  local physical markets but by midday some sections had halved
  early two stg losses while others were unchanged
      Ministry of Agriculture figures for March indicate 185 mln
  tonnes of wheat and 174 mln tonnes of barley remain in the
  free market However some traders believe these figures are
  overstated and while some may still be held on the farm the
  bulk of wheat is already sold Some of the grain is also off
  the market in futures stores
      A total of 210 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has been
  sold for export or to the home market since the season started
  July 1 leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 159
  mln tonnes
      Intervention barley sales have reached just over 10 mln
  tonnes leaving about 753000 tonnes traders said
      This seasons UK Export performance has surpassed all
  early expectations and has created the present nervous
  situation in domestic markets where the fear now is free market
  supplies may not last out until new crop becomes available in
  August
      The market is sticking to its recent prediction of total
  barley and wheat exports of around 105 mln tonnes a new
  record and nearly double the previous record of 59 mln tonnes
  achieved in the 198485 season
      Traders expect UK Wheat exports to reach 60 mln and
  barley around 450 mln tonnes
      The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 25 mln
  tonnes of British wheat and barley this season but only 128
  mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25 traders
  said
      Other EC countries have bought large amounts of British
  grain and for the July 1March 25 period had taken 259 mln
  tonnes of wheat and 206 mln tonnes of barley This compares
  with 128 mln and 868700 tonnes last season
      The market is expecting prices particularly wheat to stay
  buoyant for the remaining few months of the season If supplies
  become more difficult and prices strengthen further feed
  compounders may increase cereal substitute usage traders said
