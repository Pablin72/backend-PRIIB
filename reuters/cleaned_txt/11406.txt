NEW GASOLINE GRADE TO RAISE US REFINING COSTS
  A new grade of unleaded gasoline
  now being test marketed will increase refining costs when
  refiners can least afford it according to officials attending
  the National Petroleum Refiners Association conference here
      The new grade of unleaded gasoline has an octane level of
  89 compared with over 90 for super unleaded and 87 for regular
  unleaded gasoline
       Amoco Corp ltAN has testmarketed the new midgrade
  gasoline and hopes to sell it on a regular basis in the South
  East and Midwest by the beginning of June according to Paul
  Collier executive vice president of marketing
      Phillips Petroleum ltP expects to begin marketing the new
  89 octane unleaded gasoline in May sources said
      Converting current refinery operations to produce the 89
  octane unleaded gsoline could cost hundreds of millions of
  dollars per refinery but that depends on the present capacity
  and intensity of the refinery said Amocos Collier
      But not all oil companys welcome the introduction of
  another grade of unleaded gasoline
      Three grades are not warranted said Henry Rosenberg
  chairman of Crown Central Petroleum ltCNP Refiners will have
  to upgrade again he added
      An investment will have to be made said Archie Dunham
  executive vice president of petroleum products at Conoco an
  operating subsidiary of DuPont Corp ltDD in order to upgrade
  refinery operations
