POUND AND CANADIAN DOLLAR CAPTURING ATTENTION
  Interest in the currency futures market
  has shifted to the soaring British pound and the potentially
  explosive Canadian dollar and away from the dull Continental
  and Japanese currencies analysts said
      The June pound which added 63 cents over the past
  weekandahalf to reach a new contract high of 15930 to the
  dollar on Monday has spawned a newfound speculative boom
      Brokers have to push their clients somewhereand
  technically the pound is in the best shape PaineWebber
  analyst Jason Gillard said
      Weve tried to take a bullish approach to the pound and
  were going to stay with that theres no reason to change
  Smith Barney analyst Craig Sloane said
      Many traders took on long poundshort West German mark
  futures positions although some of those crosstrades were
  liquidated yesterday Sloane said
       The fundamental keys to the pounds rise have been
  relatively high UK interest rates and a vague optimism
  surrounding the British economy analysts said
      Money seems to be chasing yields William Byers of Bear
  Stearns said of the 1012 pct UK base lending rate
      Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in the
  pound on the inference that the Bank of England will seek to
  relieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing down
  interest rates after the nations budget is released March 17
      The budget itself could have an impact depending on how
  well it is received but analysts say relative interest rates
  and oil income remain the main influences on the currency
      However the market may be able to absorb lower UK
  interest rates as it has done when other countries have cut
  their discount rates and extend the pounds rally Sloane
  said
      The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound but
  Sloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon
      The sideways price pattern in the June contract with
  smaller and smaller price ranges has formed a bull flag on
  price charts technicallyoriented analysts said
      It makes for an explosive type of situation that often
  leads to a breakout in this case to the upside Sloane said
      Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadian
  dollar to rally above the 7700 cent level from the most recent
  close at 7480 cents to the US dollar
      At this stage of the game Id call the market longterm
  positive but for the technical burden of proof you need a
  close above the previous contract high of 7525 Byers said
      As to the traditionally more active currencies stability
  was the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts
      Sloane said it was important that June Swiss francs and
  June German marks held above support at 06400 and 05400
  respectively closing at 06438 and 05430
      Yesterdays rebound showed the market was still very
  respectful of the Paris accord and the threat of central bank
  intervention by the G5 nations plus Canada
      We may still probe to see what the parameters are Byers
  said but people are very reluctant because they dont know
  where the central banks will be to intervene
      Gillard said the mark could drop to a previous price
  consolidation area around 05250 based on the profoundly
  sluggish West German economy but that he would be a buyer at
  that level
