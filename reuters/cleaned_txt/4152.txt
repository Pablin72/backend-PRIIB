  previously reported January retail sales fell 58 pct
      Excluding autos retail sales in February were up 15 pct
  after falling by a revised 04 pct in January
      Department spokesmen said the major cause for the revision
  downward in January sales was a weaker January auto dealer
  sales figure than originally estimated

  144 pct rise from January levels But January sales dropped by
  277 pct from December levels to 2352 billion dlrs more than
