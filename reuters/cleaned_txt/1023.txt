US COMMERCE SECRETARY SAYS EXPORT RISE NEEDED
  Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
  said after the release of a sharply lower January leading
  indicator index that a pickup in exports is needed
      The best tonic for the economy now would be a pickup in net
  exports he said in a statement after the department reported
  the index fell 10 pct in January from December the sharpest
  drop since a 17 pct fall in July 1984
      The main reasons for the January decline after a 23 pct
  December rise were declines in building permits new orders for
  plant and equipment and for consumer and industrial goods
