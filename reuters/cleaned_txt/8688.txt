IRAN SAID TO TEST FIRE SILKWORM MISSILE IN HORMUZ
  Iran has testfired its newly acquired
  Silkworm antishipping missile in the Strait of Hormuz and has
  set up at least two landbased launching sites in the area a
  British naval source in the Gulf said
      The source who declined to be identified said Iran had
  fired the Chinesemade missile at a hulk off its southern Gulf
  naval port of Bandar Abbas and scored a hit
      These missiles pack a fairly big punch he told Reuters
  There is no doubt they could be used to target shipping
  across the Strait of Hormuz
      Tension in the Gulf has risen since US Officials last
  week broke the news that Iran had acquired the Silkworm
  missiles
      The US Has said it will not allow Iran to use the
  missiles to choke off oil shipments and has offered its
  warships to escort Kuwaiti tankers past the missile batteries
      But Tehran denied last Sunday it intended to threaten Gulf
  shipping and warned the US Any interference in the region
  would meet a strong response
      The British naval source said the Silkworms were in place
  at at least two sites around the Strait of Hormuz but would
  not give the exact location
