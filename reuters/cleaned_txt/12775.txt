CLOSURE OF BP SWEDEN REFINERY FORECAST
  A Swedish Finance Ministry committee
  forecast that British Petroleum Plc ltBPL may have to close
  its refinery in Gothenburg because of an anticipated worsening
  of the Swedish petroleum industrys competitiveness
      It said in a report that the future of the Swedish refining
  business was bleak due to the steady drop in domestic oil
  consumption since the mid1970s a possible tightening of rules
  on sulphur content and competition from Norways Mongstad
  facility of ltDen Norske Stats Olieselskab Statoil ltSTATOL
  when its expansion is completed in the 1990s
      The committee said the BP refinery which lacks a
  desulphurisation plant was likely to be closed or sold unless
  costly investments were made to enhance the facilitys capacity
  to refine a broader range of products
      But the committee noted that capacity utilisation had in
  recent years been above that of the European refining industry
  on average The BP plant in which Swedens stateowned ltOK
  Petroleum AB has a 22 pct started up in 1967 and has an
  annual capacity of 47 mln tonnes
      There was nobody at British Petroleum immediately available
