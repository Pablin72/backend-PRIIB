KAMPUCHEA SAYS RICE CROP IN 1986 INCREASED
  Kampuchea harvested more than two mln
  tonnes of rice paddy in 1986 up on the crops of the previous
  two years the official SPK news agency said yesterday
      Diplomats said estimates put the 1985 harvest at less than
  one mln tonnes slightly up on 800000 in 1984
      SPK said Kampuchea planned to expand planting from 15 mln
  to 193 mln hectares and boost rice paddy output to 25 mln
  tonnes this calendar year
      Two mln tonnes of paddy would produce some 13 mln tonnes
  of milled rice above the 125 mln tonnes Kampuchea says is the
  minimum its 75 mln people need
