GENSTAR SALE BOOSTS BELGIAN SOCIETE GENERALE NET
  Societe Generale de Belgique ltBELBBR
  said the near doubling of net profits in 1986 was due in large
  part to the sale of shares in Genstar Corp
      The company which announced a net nonconsolidated profit
  of 531 billion francs compared with 282 billion in 1985 said
  its current profits rose by 19 pct last year without giving
  further figures
      However it added in a statement that the company made
  major capital gains on sales during the year in particular
  from the sale of Genstar shares
      Societe Generale governor Rene Lamy told last Novembers
  annual meeting that 1986 asset disposals would total around 45
  billion francs including the sale of Genstar shares to Imasco
  Limited ltIMSTO
      He predicted a profit on extraordinary items of two billion
  francs after a rough balance in 1985
      In todays statement Societe Generale gave no figures for
  extraordinary gains
