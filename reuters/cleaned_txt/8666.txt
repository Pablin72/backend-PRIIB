NIPPON LIFE SHEARSON TIEUP SEEN SETTING TREND
  Nippon Life Insurance Cos 538 mln dlr
  purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc
  brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers
  are likely to follow securities analysts said
      The investment in one of Wall Streets top brokerage houses
  is likely to pay off in dollars and international market
  position they said Its part of a trend towards growing
  capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign
  financial institutions said Simon Smithson an analyst with
  Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo
      The investment in Shearson Lehman a growing firm described
  by some analysts as the top US Retail brokerage will give
  Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on
  Wall Street where it invests an increasing percentage of its
  assets of 902 billion dlrs they said
      Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business
  sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan they added
      The agreement between the two companies calls for a 5050
  joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset
  management market research and consulting on financing
      Nippon Life is Japans largest insurance company and the
  worlds biggest institutional investor analysts said
      The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the
  deal in April making Nippon Life the first Japanese life
  insurance firm to take a stake in a US Financial firm
      The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese
  insurers assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year
  Since then they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks
  and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and
  instruments
      Last year a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was
  appointed to EF Hutton Group Inc unit EF Hutton and Cos
  board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a
  limited partner in Goldman Sachs and Co
      Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and
  problemplagued banks in 1984 But now Japanese are going for
  bluechip organisations he said
      Its a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing
  industries said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co With a
  historically high yen and historically low interest rates
  theres an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan
      Competition in fund management has grown along with greater
  Japanese savings The typical salaried employee has 733 mln
  yen in savings reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17
  to 18 pct he said
      To stay competitive fund managers must invest overseas and
  gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to
  spread to Japan with further deregulation The high regulatory
  environment has delayed life insurance firms
  diversification Now theres a growing number of new products
  in an environment of increasing competition for performance on
  fund management Smithson said
