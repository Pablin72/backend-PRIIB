FERRUZZI NEGOTIATING EUROPEAN ACQUISITION
  Italys ltGruppo Ferruzzi is in the
  advanced stages of negotiations that could result in an
  acquisition worth some hundreds of billions of lire in the
  European agroindustrial sector a company spokesman told
  Reuters
      The spokesman declined to identify the other party or
  parties involved in talks or whether a complete takeover was
  under discussion but said an Italian newspaper report that
  Ferruzzi was studying the possibility of advancing an offer for
  13 European cereal processing plants owned by the US Group
  CPC International Inc ltCPCN was incorrect
      The spokesman said that possibility had been evaluated by
  Ferruzzi but that the companys attention at the moment was
  decisively in another direction
      The spokesman responding to a report in the Italian
  economic daily Il Sole24 Ore that Ferruzzi was considering a
  possible bid for the CPC plants told Reuters his company hoped
  to conclude the talks currently underway in a couple of months
      The spokesman said that since the UK Government last
  month blocked Ferruzzis bid to acquire ltBritish Sugar Plc
  the company had been looking at other investment opportunities
