GRAIN REPORTS IMPROVE US FARM OUTLOOKANALYSTS
  The US grain planting intentions and
  stocks reports bear optimistic news for US agriculture a
  grain analyst on a Chicago Board of Trade panel said
      The decline in intended soybean acreage and lower stocks
  are the first report weve had for a long time that shows any
  optimism for anybody said John Bud Frazier grain analyst
  and executive vice president for Balfour MacLaine Inc
      Im really excited about it Frazier said
      The US Department of Agriculture said farmers intend to
  plant 676 mln acres of corn down from 767 mln planted last
  year and 568 mln acres of soybeans down from 615 mln
      The report showed March 1 stocks of 14 billion bushels of
  soybeans 83 billion bushels of corn and 23 billion bushels
  of wheat all below trade guesses
      Frazier was joined by Susan Hackmann senior grain analyst
  with AgriAnalysis and Mark Meyer a grain analyst with
  Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc on a Chicago Board of Trade
  panel to discuss the reports
      Frazier said the stocks reports in particular were friendly
  for the market and soybean prices would jump three to five
  cents a bushel if the bell rang right now
      Were getting our disappearance up We have less corn and
  soybeans than we thought we had he said noting that hog and
  poultry production is up
      Were seeing low prices generate some interest in demand
  said Meyer adding that feed use was up 13 pct last quarter and
  15 pct in the preceding quarter
      However Hackmann said production could continue to exceed
  consumption
      She noted that most of the reductions in soybean acres came
  in southeastern states where yields are usually low
      We have the potential for record breaking soybean yields
  this year which will temper the enthusiasm on tomorrows
  opening she said
      Hackmann said record corn yields also are possible and the
  crop could reach 71 billion bushels which would be down from
  last years 825 billion bushels
      Well need very good disappearance next year to reduce
  stocks she said The USDA estimated disappearance last year
  at 67 billion bushels
      Hackmann said the stocks report was positive for the long
  term But we still have a long way to go to bring stocks down
  to where we could start rebuilding prices
      Frazier also cautioned that the soybean acreage report
  could prompt farmers to change their plans and plant more
  soybeans
      The panelists agreed that the reports should discourage
  talk of revising the 1985 farm bill
      There seems to be no desire  to change the farm law
  were working under today and this report should reinforce
  that Frazier said
      We are seeing the program beginning to work said Meyer
