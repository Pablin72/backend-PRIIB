SAUDI OUTPUT SAID AT YEAR LOW TO HELP OPEC
  Saudi Arabian oil output has fallen to
  its lowest level in more than a year giving fresh evidence of
  the kingdoms determination to keep oil prices at 18 dlrs a
  barrel as agreed by Opec last December oil industry sources
  said
      They said Saudi output in the first eight days of March
  averaged 26 mln barrels per day bpd including oil from the
  neutral zone shared with Kuwait compared to a February average
  of 35 mln bpd
      They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crude
  oil stocks in tankers around the world which OPEC says must be
  counted towards a members production quota Saudi Arabias
  quota is 4133 mln bpd
      The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia the
  worlds largest oil exporter was insisting on getting Opec
  official prices even at the cost of lower production the
  sources said
      King Fahd reiterated yesterday in an interview with
  Reuters and the television news agency Visnews the Saudi
  commitment to OPECs December pact to boost oil prices to an
  average 18 dlrs
      Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions he
  said
      The sources said the kingdoms exports from Gulf ports
  averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday
  down from a February average of 19 mln bpd
      They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuate
  with lifting nominations and was not trying to maintain
  artificially high levels by putting oil into storage
      The kingdoms main buyers the four US Oil firms with
  past stakes in the national oil company Aramco  Mobil Exxon
  Texaco and Chevron  enjoy considerable flexibility in the
  timing and volume of their liftings but are bound to pay
  official prices the sources said
      Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks but
  still remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayed
  liftings in the hope they would improve the sources said
      They expected low early March output to pick up towards the
  end of the month as buyers sought to fulfill their contractual
  obligations
