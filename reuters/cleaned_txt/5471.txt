COLOMBIA COFFEE EXPORTERS BELIEVE IN PRAGMATISM
  Private coffee exporters say Colombias
  more pragmatic coffee marketing policy will ensure that the
  country does not suffer excessively from current depressed
  prices and erratic market conditions
      Gilberto Arango president of the exporters association
  said in an interview that Colombia the worlds second largest
  producer was in a position to withstand a prolonged absence of
  International Coffee Organization ICO export quotas
      Colombia is one of the countries that will benefit most
  from this situation he said
      Recent ICO talks in London failed to break a deadlock over
  reintroduction of export quotas suspended in February 1986
  and no date has been set for a new meeting on the issue
      Arango said that government measures adopted here last
  week including a lower export registration price indicated a
  major change but also disclosed a welcome pragmatism
      This is the start of a new era in Colombia because world
  market conditions are also new he said
      The government lowered local taxes for exporters and said
  the export registration price or reintegro will be changed
  more often in order to closely reflect market trends
      Arango said an illustration of Colombias new attitude was
  the decision on Friday to open export registrations for an
  unlimited amount
      But he added it did not imply the country would begin heavy
  selling of coffee
      Our marketing policy is to sell without haste but
  consistently No targets for volume will be set We will react
  to market factors adequately and Colombia has no intention of
  giving its coffee away
      Colombias past records should be the basis for upcoming
  exports he said
      We will certainly not export seven mln 60kilo bags but
  neither are we going to sell like mad The trade knows full
  well what Colombias export potential is he said
      Colombia with stockpiles standing at about 10 mln bags
  exported a record 115 mln bags in the 198586 coffee year
  which ended last September and 113 mln in calendar 1986
      Arango did not want to commit himself on export predictions
  but said that output for the 198687 coffee year would not
  exceed 105 mln bags compared with 12 mln forecast by the
  National Coffee Growers Federation and 125 mln by the US
  Department of Agriculture a figure he said was ridiculous
      He said ageing plantations and rust in particular in the
  number one producing province of Antioquia meant output was
  likely to fall but that nationwide estimates were rare and
  oscillated between 95 mln and 115 mln bags
      On the failure of the recent ICO talks Arango said
  Colombia understandably felt frustrated at not having managed
  to force a compromise
      Jorge Cardenas manager of the national federation and head
  of his nations delegation in London has blamed the
  intransigence of some big countries without naming them
      However Arango like Colombian Finance Minister Cesar
  Gaviria last week was more explicit and said the United States
  would undoubtedly be under great political pressure in coming
  weeks to revise its policy
      Washington will have to take into account that for many
  countries and some of its allies for instance in Central
  America a sharp fall in coffee export revenue would have
  farreaching political and economic consequences
      Arango ruled out a fresh Colombian initiative on export
  quotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve which
  could emerge from continuous contacts
