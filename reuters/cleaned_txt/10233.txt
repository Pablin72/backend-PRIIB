GREAT AMERICAN ltGTAM SEES CHARGE WRITEDOWN
  Great American Corp said
  preliminary findings by regulatory examiners of its AMBANK
  subsidiary will result in a first quarter charge of 141 mln
  dlrs and a writedown of 14 mln dlrs
      The charge will be made against the allowance for possible
  loan losses and the writedown is of other real estate
      Great American said the examiners were conducting a regular
  examination and a final report is not expected for several
  weeks Management intends to include the charge and writedown
  in response to the preliminary findings
      Great American said regulatory authorities are not
  requiring an adjustment of the previously reported financial
  results for Great American for 1986
      However Great American has revised its previous estimates
  of provisions for possible losses and has added 99 mln dlrs to
  the allowance account as of December 31 1986 It said it took
  the action since the chargeoffs will significantly deplete its
  allowance for possible loan losses and the economic environment
  does not show signs for significant improvement in the near
  future
      It said the additional provision increases the allowance to
  264 mln dlrs representing 663 pct of the outstanding loan
  portfolio and 832 pct of nonperforming loans at yearend
      Great American said its revised net loss for the fourth
  quarter is 141 mln dlrs or 636 dlrs per share compared to a
  net loss of 24 mln dlrs or 106 dlrs per share the year
  earlier
