FED SEEN CONTENT WITH US FEBRUARY ECONOMY
  US February reports reflecting slim
  gains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressures
  reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue
  to follow a stable course of monetary policy economists said
      If youre the Fed theres no reason to do anything said
  Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc
      There are hints that GNP is picking up On the inflation
  front all is well he said Money supply is well under
  control Its an absolutely ideal situation
      February US industrial production rose 05 pct slightly
  less than the 07 pct gain the financial markets had expected
  This compared with a slim 01 pct rise in Januarys production
  number previously reported as a 04 pct increase
      The February US producer price index gained only 01 pct
  less than a 0304 pct expected rise This followed a 06 pct
  rise in the PPI in January
      The Fed is going to look at this positively said Allan
  Leslie of Discount Corporation Certainly inflation is not as
  bad as what Volcker Fed Chairman has said lately Industrial
  production growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants
      The energy products component of PPI rose 40 pct in
  February after a 98 pct increase in January
      This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation
  is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per
  barrel said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc The
  trend is still 35 pct in the first half of the year
      In 1986 declining energy prices contributed to a 25 pct
  decline in the PPI
      Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected
  but a sharp drop in auto prices was not Passenger car prices
  fell 34 pct and light truck prices dropped 13 pct
      Yesterday Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that
  a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both
  the financial markets and the Federal Reserve
      The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations
  today said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International
      While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier
  monetary policy Brusca said if import prices do not rise this
  could necessitate a weaker dollar
      The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air he
  said We need inflation for US producers to compete with
  foreign producers
      Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 08 pct
  in Februarys PPI With many electronic goods produced
  overseas this may show that foreign producers are not raising
  prices which bodes ill for US competitiveness he said
      If further dollar declines are needed this could diminish
  overseas investment in US debt Brusca added which might
  necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices
      By contrast Slifer said imported goods prices rose 118
  pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to
  a large degree a 22 pct drop in the tradeweighted real value
  of the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987
      Slifer said import prices may rise further as
  manufacturers contracts put in place before the dollar dropped
  to current levels expire and new contracts are made that
  reflect a weaker dollar
      David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported
  manufactured goods prices rose 85 pct at an annual rate in the
  second half of 1986 which has contributed to rising US
  industrial output
      Its the other side of the lower dollar Wyss said
  Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive
  and they are increasing output
      Wyss said that the latest data point to an average
  industrial production gain of 0304 pct in the first quarter
  Its an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is
  beginning to revive
      But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not 
  convinced that the February reports portend economic gains He
  said much of the strength came from factors that do not point
  to a sustained rise in industrial output
      Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm
  equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in
  February business equipment production
      Utilities output rose 07 pct in February after gaining 12
  pct in January but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy
  was produced not that manufacturing activity gained
      Finally he pointed out that auto production accounted for
  half of the industrial production gain as production of auto
  assemblies rose to 83 million units at an annual rate from 75
  million units
      In the first quarter it looks like automakers are
  producing at an 85 mln unit annual rate but selling at
  roughly a seven mln unit rate Roach said The disparity
  between output and sales is showing up in inventories
      Economists pointed to sharp rise in January US business
  inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping
  demand in the first quarter of 1987
      January business inventories rose 09 pct the largest gain
  since July 1979 when inventories rose 17 pct the Commerce
  Department said Business sales dropped 45 pct in January the
  largest monthly sales drop on record
      Nonetheless economists do not expect the Fed to react to
  monthtomonth changes The Fed has been standing pat for the
  last seven months Ramirez said They will continue to stand
  pat for at least the next couple of months
