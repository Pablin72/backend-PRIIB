US SUGAR PROGRAM CUT SENT TO CONGRESS BY USDA
  The US Agriculture Department 
  formally transmitted to Congress a longawaited proposal to
  drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers
  for the cut with targeted income payments
      In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying
  the Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987 Peter Myers
  Deputy Agriculture Secretary said the Reagan administration
  wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning
  with the 1987 crop down from 18 cts now
      Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the
  government for the price support cut with targeted income
  payments over the four years 1988 to 1991 The payments would
  cost an estimated 11 billion dlrs Myers said
      The administration sugar proposal is expected to be
  introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep
  John Porter RIll
      Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it
  is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because
  politicallyinfluential sugar and corn growers
  and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist
      The direct payment plan outlined by the administration 
  targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually
  lowers payments over four years It also excludes from payment
  any output exceeding 20000 short tons raw sugar per grower
      For example on the first 350 tons of production a grower
  would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988 45 cts in 1989 3
  cts in 1990 and 15 cts in 1991
      The income payments would be based on the amount of
  commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985
  or 1986 crop years whichever is less USDA said
      Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes
  in the sugar program because the current high price support is
  causing adverse trends in the sugar industry
      He said the current program has artificially stimulated
  domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed
  corn sweeteners to make market inroads
      US sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a
  progressive contraction of the sugar import quota to only one
  mln short tons this year he said This has hurt cane sugar
  refiners who rely on imported sugar processing
      Furthermore USDA said the current sugar program gives
  overseas manufacturers of sugarcontaining products a
  competitive advantage The result has been higher imports of
  sugarcontaining products and a flight of US processing
  facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar
      USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on
  US consumers and industrial users In fiscal 1987 USDA said
  consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than
  necessary for sugar
      Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between
  sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse
  impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently
  facing Myers said

  lb to growers and the quantity covered in short tons
