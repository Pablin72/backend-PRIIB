ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT  ASIAN DROUGHTS
  Three geographically diverse droughts
  in Asia are being linked by some scientists to a
  reintensification of the complex and littleunderstood El Nino
  weather pattern ltAccuWeather Inc a commercial weather
  forecasting service said
      Rice and wheat farmers in China wheat and sugarcane
  growers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all face
  serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive
  in time to break the droughts offical reports government
  officials and meteorologists said
      Wen Wei Po a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links said
  the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces
  have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months
      Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces it added
      Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan
  was 70 pct below average during February the lowest figure for
  over 20 years the paper said
      The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct
  compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many
  rivers it added
      This has resulted in reduced hydroelectric power causing
  shortages to industry and households The upper reaches of the
  Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century causing many
  ships to run aground Wen Wei Po said
      Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across
  China media reports said The Peoples Daily said Sichuan has
  recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average
  since early February
      The New China News Agency said the average December
  temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher
  than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984
      Severe drought is affecting about onethird of Sri Lanka
  and threatens to reduce the countrys tea crop Ministry of
  Plantation Industries officials told Reuters
      In Australia concern is growing about belowaverage
  rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the
  Queensland coast and in Western Australias wheat belt local
  Meteorological Bureau officials said
      For many farmers and government officials the fear is that
  while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major
  threat the prospect of a dry autumnwinter season when the
  wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does they added
      Concern is heightened by the memory of the 198283 drought
  which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the
  occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as
  El Nino they said
      Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the
  AsiaPacific regions disrupted weather patterns to any single
  cause El Ninos role is being closely studied they said
      AccuWeather Inc which specialises in providing data for
  agriculture and shipping interests said each El Nino event
  was unique
      The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and
  the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last
  major event in 198283 it said
      El Nino Spanish for Christ Child because it appears around
  Christmas is formed by the action of warm air bearing clouds
  and rain shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast
  of Peru where it mingles with the cold waters associated with
  the Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade
  winds meteorologists said
      The winds strengthened by El Ninos pump effect raise the
  sea level off Australia and Indonesia they said
      When the winds drop the ocean seeking equilibrium sends
  a surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it
  collides with the cold seas off Peru they said
      One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the
  rainbearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the
  Pacific where they further disrupt other weather patterns
      The prospects for an end to the droughts vary AccuWeather
  said
      China where the affected areas have received between 40
  and 75 pct of normal rainfall will have to wait for the
  MaySeptember rains it said
      The MaySeptember rains normally provide the
  droughtstriken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall
      In Australia areas of Queenslands coastal strip have
  received less than half the normal rainfall during the current
  wet season but prospects for increased rains are diminishing
  as the rainy season draws to an end
      In Sri Lanka the drought has come when rainfall should be
  at its maximum for the year The years secondary rains usually
  occur between April and June although it is not possible at
  this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual
