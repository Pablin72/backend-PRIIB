FERC DECISION COULD CUT COLUMBIA GAS ltCG NET
  Columbia Gas System Inc said a
  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision today on natural
  gas cost recovery could reduce its 1987 earnings by about 125
  dlrs a share
      The company said this could bring earnings for 1987 below
  Columbias stated goal of earning no less than its 318 dlrs
  per share dividend It earned 212 dlrs a share in 1986
      It said management expects to recommend to the board that
  the dividend rate be maintained in 1987
      Columbia Gas said the impact of the FERC decision may be
  offset by a onetime accounting change rleated to future tax
  liabilities under the new federal tax laws
      The company recorded these liabilities based on older
  higher tax rates but an action being considered by the
  Financial Accounting Standards Board could result in a gain of
  about 120 dlrs a share in 1987 it explained
      Thus there is a good chance that we will attain our 1987
  earnings goal  although not in the way originally planned
  Columbia Gas said
      Columbia Gas said the FERC decision would limit the
  recovery of certain gas contract costs by Columbia Gas
  Transmission Corp the companys principal pipeline subsidiary
      It said the decision specifically excluded from a purchased
  gas adjustment filing by the pipeline costs related to
  amortizing payments made to producers to reform gas purchase
  contracts These were excluded on the grounds the subsidiary
  failed to sufficiently support cost recovery
      The company said its subsidiary is not precluded from
  making a new filing to provide sufficient support
