AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO PAY SUBSIDIESUSDA
  The Australian Government will likely
  reimburse the Australian Wheat Board AWB about 132 mln US
  dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 198687 crop the US
  Agriculture Department said
      In its report on Export Markets for US Grains the
  department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has
  reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels
  insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at
  around 98 dlrs per tonne
       For example the recent large sales of wheat to China 15
  mln tonnes and Egypt 20 mln tonnes were well below the
  breakeven export price it said
      Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance
  payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price GMP calculated
  at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current
  year and the two lowest of the previous three years the
  department said
      In addition deductions for taxes freight handling and
  storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives
      But the department said the Australian Bureau of
  Agricultural Economics BAE predicts wheat production will
  drop sharply from 178 mln tonnes in 198687 to 135 mln in
  198990
      The decline will result from low world grain prices leading
  to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit US
  wheat exports the department said
