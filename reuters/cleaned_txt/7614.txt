BANK OF SPAIN SUSPENDS ASSISTANCE DRAINS FUNDS
  The Bank of Spain suspended its daily
  money market assistance and offered to drain funds with three
  and sevenday repurchase agreements at 1212 pct money market
  sources said
      The sources said the measures were a further attempt to
  rein in money supply and were likely to force some institutions
  to scramble for funds before the 10day accounting period for
  reserve requirements closes on Monday
      The bank which raised its rate for ordinary overnight
  assistance to 1334 from 1312 pct on Wednesday opened its
  special borrowing facility for overnight funds at 1412 pct
      Money market sources said institutions in need of funds
  were likely to have to return to the bank tomorrow for further
  assistance
      The bank rarely invites applications for ordinary
  assistance on a Saturday and the sources said it was more
  likely to open its special borrowing facility again
