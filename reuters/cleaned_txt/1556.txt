  to 3007 mln long dwt in February from 3725 mln tons in
  January and 4144 mln in December London shipbroker Howard

  of the Mideast Gulf which totalled 74 mln tons last month
  against 1165 mln in January These included shipments to
  western options at 205 mln tons against 359 mln previously
      Liftings from the Gulf to eastern options fell to 415 mln
  tons from 594 mln and those from the Gulf to other areas
  dropped to 12 mln tons from 213 mln Howard Houlder said
