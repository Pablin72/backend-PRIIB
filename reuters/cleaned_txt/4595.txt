US HOUSE PANEL APPROVES TRADE BILL
  The US House Ways and Means Trade
  Subcommittee unanimously approved a toneddown version of
  legislation designed to toughen US trade laws and wedge open
  foreign markets to more US goods
      The measure now goes to the full House Ways and Means
  Committee next week but major changes are not expected
  congressional sources said
      This product could very well be toughening our trade policy
  and doing it in a manner that opens markets without this
  frightening word protectionism Ways and Means chairman Dan
  Rostenkowski an Illinois Democrat said
      The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific
  retaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade
  practices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year
      But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee
  debate on a controversial plan by Rep Richard Gephardt to
  mandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the US by
  countries such as Japan South Korea and Taiwan
      Gephardt a Missouri Democrat has not decided the exact
  form of his amendment an aide said Last year the House
  approved his idea to force an annual 10 pct trade surplus cut
  by those countries
