IEA FORECASTS SLOWER GROWTH IN OECD OIL DEMAND
  Growth in oil consumption in the Western
  industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct
  this year compared with 23 pct in 1986 the International
  Energy Agency said
      Oil use in the 24 member countries of the Organization for
  Economic Cooperation and Development OECD increased by around
  one pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 359 mln barrels a day
  the IEA said in its latest monthly report
      Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from
  transport fuels as was the case in 1986 But if average
  consumer prices are higher than 1986 the rate of growth for
  these fuels may be below last years 36 pct
      The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain nar
  current levels some destocking by endusers can be expected
      If that takes place natural gas will also regain some of
  the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986 it said
      IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECD
  area at 428 mln tonnes or 98 days of forward consumption This
  is about the same as at the begining of the year
      The agency said this flat trend is explained by the
  projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of
  the year which offset a reduction in stocks
      Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes
  on April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender
  1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to
  102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986
      The yearonyear trend of government stock building is
  continuing with company stocks rising more or less in line
  with consumption after declining for five years IEA said
      Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were put
  at 2066 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January one
  and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption respectively
      Oil stocks in Western Europe were 1474 mln tonnes down
  from the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to
  94 days of consumption
      The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that company
  stocks fell by 12 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first
  quarter of the year This followed a small rise in January of
  400000 bpd but a decline of 15 bpd in February and 25 bpd in
  March
      And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw
  particulary for March it said
      As crude production also fell there is likely to have also
  been a decline in nonreported stocks particularly at sea the
  IEA said
      World oil supply fell through the first quarter by about
  two bpd to 452 bpd from 475 bpd in the last quarter of 1986
      This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude
  production to around 155 bpd in FebruaryMarch from 165 bpd
  in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from Centrally
  Planned Economies the IEA said
      Total OPEC oil supply totalled 172 bpd in the first
  quarter of 1987 compare with 193 bpd in the last three months
  of 1986 while supply from nonOPEC countries totalled 28 bpd as
  against 282 bpd in the same 1986 period
      A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast
  33 bpd in march from 36 bpd in February was the largest
  factor behind the OPEC production decline the IEA said
