CUBAN SUGAR OUTPUT SEEN AT 75 MLN TONNES
  Cuban sugar output this season 198687
  is put at around 75 mln tonnes raw value by broker CCzarnikow
  in its monthly sugar market review
      Allowing for around 700000 tonnes for the current years
  domestic usage it would leave around 68 mln tonnes for export
  of which Czarnikow estimates about 37 mln tonnes will be
  taken by the USSR 1530 mln by other socialist countries and
  the remainder for delivery to nonsocialist bloc destinations
      Czarnikow also estimated USSR 198687 production at 875
  mln tonnes raw value which when added to the 37 mln imports
  from Cuba and set against its estimated domestic and export
  needs of 142 mln tonnes will leave a gap of 175 mln tonnes to
  be acquired from the world market Soviet purchases to date may
  not be far short of that quantity Czarnikow said
