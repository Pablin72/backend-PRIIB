FRENCH FARMERS PLAN TO CUT MAIZE PLANTINGS
  French farmers are planning to cut their
  maize sowings by between 100000 and 150000 hectares this year
  from the 187 mln ha harvested in 1986 the French Maize
  Producers Association AGPM said
      It said its first estimate of planting intentions indicated
  cuts of 15 to 20 pct in plantings in the northern region of
  Picardy and the Paris Basin which harvested 192000 ha last
  year
      In the centrewest region of PoitouCharentes plantings
  were estimated four to seven pct up on last years harvested
  244000 ha
      Planting intentions in the southeast ranged between nine
  pct less and two pct more than last years 125000 ha In the
  southwest the AGPM said producers intended to plant a similar
  area to last years 671100 harvested hectares provided water
  supplies are adequate in the MidiPyrenees region after the
  last two years of drought
      Meanwhile the oilseed plant breeding association AMSOL
  said sunflower plantings in France this year are indicated at
  between 900000 and 950000 ha against 829000 harvested last
  year while soya plantings are indicated at 80000 ha against
  last years harvested 48000
