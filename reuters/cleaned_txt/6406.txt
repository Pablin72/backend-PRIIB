NEW ZEALAND ECONOMY FORECAST TO IMPROVE IN 198788
  New Zealands inflation and interest
  rates should decline and the balance of payments improve
  significantly in the fiscal year to the end of March 1988 the
  Institute of Economic Research NZIER said
      The independent institute said in its quarterly March issue
  that it was also revising its fiscal 1987 real gross domestic
  product GDP forecast to a fall of 05 pct against the one pct
  drop forecast in December
      Government figures show GDP grew at an annual 18 pct in
  the quarter to September and 34 pct in the June quarter
      The NZIER said the sharp improvement in the June and
  September quarters was due mainly to a new tax structure and
  the introduction of a 10 pct valueadded goods and services tax
  and is not expected to continue in the second half of 198687
      The governments tight fiscal position is not expected to
  change it said
      Annual inflation measured by the consumer price index is
  forecast to fall to nine pct by next March from 182 pct in
  calendar 1986 it said
      Falling inflation is likely to give significant scope for
  reductions in nominal interest rates real interest rates are
  also expected to ease albeit slightly as the balance of
  payments deficit and hence the call on overseas capital falls
  away the NZIER said
      Shortterm interest rates are forecast to remain between 20
  and 25 pct until the June quarter but will decline over the
  second half of 198788 to between 16 and 18 pct Longterm
  rates are expected to fall to between 14 and 16 pct
      Five year government bond rates are currently 1840 pct and
  the key indicator 30day bank bills 2653 pct
      The local dollar is expected to depreciate steadily in the
  early part of the coming year and by next March reach 575 on
  the Reserve Banks trade weighted index which is based on a
  basket of currencies The index now stands at around 664
      A marked improvement in the balance of payments is
  forecast the NZIER said The current account deficit is
  expected to fall from 75 pct of GDP in 198586 to 45 pct in
  198687 and 25 pct in 198788
      The current account deficit is forecast to shrink to 132
  billion NZ Dlrs in 198788 from 240 billion in 198687 and
  333 billion in 198586
      The 198788 budget deficit is forecast to be 28 billion
  dlrs against an expected 29 billion dlrs in 198687 and 187
  billion in 198586
      This compares with the governments 198687 deficit figure
  of 292 billion against an earlier forecast of 245 billion
      Conditions in the coming year are sufficiently subdued to
  contribute to marked improvements in both the balance of
  payments and the rate of inflation  the NZIER said
      Overall these are significant gains for the New Zealand
  economy and if they continue to be improved upon bode well
  for future prospects
