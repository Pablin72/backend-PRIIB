CHINAS FIRST JOINT VENTURE BANK REPORTS PROFIT
  Chinas first joint venture bank Xiamen
  International Bank XIB reported a group net profit of about
  14 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 the banks first full year of
  operation
      General manager Liu Shuxun declined to give a 1987 profit
  forecast saying targets were under study
      Assistant general manager Wang Hongshan said the groups
  outstanding loans at end1986 totalled 620 mln Hong Kong dlrs
  up from 530 mln at end1985 Deposits and interbank borrowings
  rose to 680 mln dlrs from 550 mln he told Reuters
      Liu said most of the groups profit came from the parent
  company rather than its two whollyowned subsidiaries ltXiamen
  International Finance Co Ltd in Hong Kong and ltLuso
  International Bank Ltd in Macao
      The joint venture bank began operating in September 1985
  but did not officially open until March 1986
      Liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreign
  partner Hong Konglisted ltPanin Holdings Ltd had been cut
  last year to 49 pct from 60 pct This was done because foreign
  banks felt the XIBs reputation would be improved if the three
  Chinese partners collectively held a majority stake he said
      Liu said news reports about problems concerning Panin were
  unfounded but he did not elaborate Panin Holdings reported a
  loss of 199 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of
  268000 dlrs in 1985
      The Chinese partners are Industrial and Commercial Bank of
  China Fujian branch whose share rose to 235 pct from 15
  Fujian Investment and Enterprise Corporation 175 pct 15 and
  Xiamen Construction and Development Corporation 10 pct 10
      One foreign banker said Xiamen International Bank faced the
  same problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete on
  unequal terms with stateowned banks
      The foreign banking market in Xiamen is thin and almost
  saturated he added
      Officials of the joint venture bank said they benefitted
  from contacts made through its three Chinese partners But the
  foreign banker who asked not to be named said it faced
  internal competition from the Industrial and Commercial Bank
      Apart from Xiamen International Bank and the International
  Agricultural Development Bank planned by the World Bank and the
  stateowned Agricultural Bank of China Xiamen has eight
  foreign bank branches or representative offices mostly of Hong
  Kong or overseas Chinese banks
