BRITISH TELECOM CAUTIOUS ON EARNINGS PROSPECTS
  British Telecommunications Plcs ltBTYL
  profit growth prospects for the coming years will be reduced by
  increasing competition and continued costs for replacing old
  telephone systems deputy chairman Graeme Odgers said
      Speaking at a news conference on the third quarter results
  which were released earlier today Odgers said the company
  faced heavy costs for installing new digital telephone systems
  in Britain for three to five years
      He said ltMercury Communications Ltd a Cable and Wireless
  Plc ltCAWLL subsidiary was becoming a significant competitor
      Odgers said Mercury was seeking to make inroads into some
  of British Telecoms most profitable areas
      One company official privately estimated that British
  Telecom still had a 99 pct share of the UK Telecommunications
  market but feared that this could slip to 95 or 90 pct
      The recent twoandahalfweek engineering strike which
  lead to some disruption in service could well have encouraged
  clients to consider using the Mercury system Odgers said
      However he forecast that the last quarters results
  overall should not be adversely affected by the walkout
      He calculated salary savings as a result of the strike at
  50 mln stg and while loss of income on telephone calls should
  be limited revenue probably dropped on peripheral activities
      But on balance Odgers said that groups financial strength
  economies of scale and the fact that it operates in a growth
  industry will help produce annual profit increases for the
  forseeable future
      British Telecom will also seek to expand into
  manufacturing he said adding that research and development
  expenditure will rise both in terms of value and compared with
  the current proportion of two pct of overall turnover
      Analysts said the companys downbeat forecasts helped
  shares dip to 242p in midafternoon down 4p from yesterdays
  close and off an early high of 248p
      Philip Augar of stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Ltd said
  the market expects slower profit growth but forecast a seven
  to eight pct rise in both earnings per share and pretax profit
  over the next two years In the 198586 financial year pretax
  profit rose to 181 billion stg from 148 billion
      Augar noted that a governmentimposed formula linking
  charges to inflation meant that the companys scope for raising
  prices was limited as long as inflation remains low
