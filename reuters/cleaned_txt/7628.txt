JAPAN UNDER ATTACK OVER TRADE SURPLUS
  Japans economic policies face fierce
  international attack as hopes fade of a substantial drop in its
  trade surplus international monetary sources said
      At a meeting this week in Paris senior government
  officials from major nations are considering an Organisation
  for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD staff report
  that forecasts a continuing large Japanese trade surplus they
  said
      Though Japanese exports have become more expensive with the
  yens sharp rise against the dollar they still tend to surge
  when growth picks up according to the OECD
      As a solution the OECD staff has urged Japan to redirect
  its exportdriven economy boosting domestic demand and imports
  by adopting a more flexible fiscal policy they said
      That recommendation echoes calls made recently at secret
  meetings of the International Monetary Funds executive board
      The monetary sources said Japans policy was criticized
  when the board met to consider the countrys economy under the
  annual consultations it holds with each of its members
      The United States which until recently has been reluctant
  to criticize Japans fiscal stance joined in the attack he
  said
      The IMF staff has also cast doubt on the Japanese
  governments forecast of 35 pct economic growth in the fiscal
  year beginning April 1 Most independent forecasters including
  the IMF believe that growth in calendar 1987 will be below
  three pct monetary sources said
      The Finance Ministry has been particularly sensitive to
  such criticism because it is already under mounting domestic
  pressure to boost an economy hardhit by the yens rise The
  yens climb has lost exporters sales and profits in the huge
  American market
      Tokyo is also eager to avoid any suggestion that a further
  yen rise might be needed to cut its trade surplus which last
  year amounted to a record 93 billion dlrs
      Japan cannot tolerate a further rise of the yen Foreign
  Minister Tadashi Kuranari said recently The yen closed here
  today at 15153 to the dollar Most Japanese politicians
  including Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa are clearly hoping
  the yen will weaken government officials said
      At a meeting in Paris last month Britain Canada France
  Japan the United States and West Germany agreed to cooperate
  to hold currencies at around current levels
      Officials said that wording represented a compromise
  Miyazawa hopes the agreement will hold the yen stable for a few
  months before it weakens later in the year
      Japan wanted the Paris communique to imply a higher value
  for the dollar perhaps by substituting the word recent for
  current while the United States wanted it to more clearly
  point to the dollars weaker levels now perhaps by use of the
  word present they said
      In the months leading up the February 22 agreement the
  dollar dropped some 10 yen
      The officials also sought to discredit suggestions in the
  market that recent US Action to prevent the dollar from
  rising above 187 marks pointed to a 153 to 155 yen ceiling for
  the US Currency
      Japan has also attacked OECD forecasts which it says do
  not take account of the structural changes in the Japanese
  economy that will be triggered by the strong yen
      Officials said there are already signs of that More and
  more companies have announced plans to move production
  facilities offshore to take advantage of cheaper costs abroad
