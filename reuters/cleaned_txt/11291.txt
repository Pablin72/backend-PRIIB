ECONOMISTS CUT AUSTRIAN GDP GROWTH FORECAST
  The Institute for Economic Research
  WIFO said it has cut its forecast for Austrias 1987 gross
  domestic product growth to a real one pct from a two pct
  forecast made last December
      WIFO chief Helmut Kramer told a new conference that he saw
  the one pct figure which compares with 18 pct last year as
  the upper limit of growth The institute had made the revision
  due to poor prospects for Austrian exports he added
      A collapse in sales to the Eastern European and oil
  producing states combined with the effects of the dollars
  fall mean exports overall are unlikely to rise this year
      Kramer said domestic demand alone would fuel growth this
  year After last years 28 pct rise in real incomes private
  consumption was likely to rise 225 pct in 1987 after 19 pct
  in 1986 despite a present trend towards higher savings
      Unemployment was likely to rise to almost six pct from 52
  pct last year due to the slack economic activity
      Kramer said the current account was likely to run a deficit
  of about four billion schillings compared with a 26 billion
  surplus recorded last year The National Bank Austrias
  central bank last month forecast the current account would be
  roughly in balance this year
      However Kramer said the lower economic growth should have
  no notable effect on the governments attempts to cut the
  budget deficit This years aim of reducing the deficit to 49
  pct of GDP from 51 pct in 1986 could still be achieved he
  said
