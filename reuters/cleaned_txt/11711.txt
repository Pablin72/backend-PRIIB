DOME PETEltDMP TAKES 208 BILLION DLR WRITEDOWN
  Dome Petroleum Ltd earlier
  reporting a 220 billion dlr 1986 loss compared to yearearlier
  profit of 70 mln dlrs said the loss was mainly due to write
  downs totalling 2084 billion dlrs before a reduction in
  deferred income taxes of 571 mln dlrs
      The loss also includes 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreign
  exchange losses the company said
      The dramatic drop in energy prices in early 1986 reverses
  much of the progress the company has made in the two previous
  years Dome chairman J Howard Macdonald said in a statement
      But even a net loss of this magnitude has very little
  bearing on the daytoday operations of Dome chairman
  Macdonald said
      It merely reflects the realistic carrying value of the
  companys assets in todays economic environment and the
  absolute need for reaching a timely agreement with our lenders
  on a debt restructuring plan to assure the companys continued
  existence he added
      Dome is now trying to reach agreement on a complex plan for
  restructuring debt of more than 610 billion dlrs
      Dome said it charged the 214 mln dlrs in accumulated
  foreign exchange losses to current expenses because of the
  uncertainty arising from its proposed restructuring plan
      Normally the expenses would be amortized over the remaining
  period of the loans to which they apply it said
      Dome also said the write downs included a fourth quarter
  reduction in the value of its oil and gas properties of 120
  billion dlrs before a reduction in deferred income taxes of
  305 mln dlrs The fourth quarter writedown was in addition to a
  charge of 880 mln dlrs on certain other assets taken mainly in
  the third quarter
      Dome said the 120 billion dlr fourth quarter charge
  resulted from a yearend accounting change made under new full
  cost accounting guidelines by the Canadian Institute of
  Chartered Accountants
      The company said it previously determined a write down of
  conventional oil and gas properties was not required at
  September 30 under the previous method of calculating the
  limitation of oil and gas values
      Dome said the most significant accounting change under the
  new guidelines is using current oil and gas prices in
  calculations instead of escalating price forecasts
      Terms of Domes proposed debt restructuring plan preclude
  the company from making an accurate estimate of future
  financing costs which are used in the new accounting
  calculations it said
      As a result Dome adopted current prices and costs and a 10
  pct discount factor in the calculations which substantially
  conform with accounting rules prescribed by the US Securities
  and Exchange Commission the company said
      Dome said operating income from its crude oil and natural
  gas segments fell by 250 billion dlrs to a 1986 loss of 171
  billion dlrs from prior year earnings of 7370 mln dlrs
      Dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gas
  operating income was due to write downs totalling 193 billion
  dlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue
      Reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization of
  Domes offshore drilling fleet in the Beaufort Sea also
  contributed to the decline it said
      Earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by 79
  pct to 420 mln dlrs from 199 mln dlrs in 1985
      Cash from operations dropped to 50 mln dlrs from yearago
  5420 mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to 2020
  mln dlrs from 4660 mln dlrs
      Dome said 1986 crude oil production in 1986 was maintained
  at prior years levels through new drilling activity and
  improvements in productivity
      Natural gas production fell by nine pct as a result of
  lower domestic and export sales it said
      Oil and field natural gas liquids production totalled
  86000 barrels a day compared to 87000 bpd in the prior year
      Natural gas production fell to 5360 mln cubic feet a day
  from 5910 mcf a day
