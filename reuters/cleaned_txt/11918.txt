THYSSEN SEES UP TO 20 PCT LOWER SALES IN 198687
  Thyssen AG ltTHYHF expects a fall of
  between 15 and 20 pct in consolidated turnover in 198687
  chief executive Dieter Spethmann said
      He told journalists the exact decline would depend on
  dollar developments The Thyssen group did over 50 pct of its
  business outside West Germany
      Spethmann made no comment on 198687 group earnings World
  group net profit fell to 3701 mln marks in the year ended
  September 1986 from 4724 mln a year earlier on group sales
  which fell to 4000 billion marks from a previous 4432
  billion
      Last week Spethmann told the annual meeting Thyssen
  expected to post a good profit in 198687 despite expected
  losses in the mass steelmaking operations this year
      Spethmann said engineering turnover would not be lower this
  year but lower steel prices would result in a drop in steel
  turnover and sales volume This would also affect Thyssens
  trading operations he said
      Spethmann also categorically denied a magazine article
  published this week which spoke of a dispute between him and
  Heinz Kriwet management board chairman of Thyssen Stahl AG
  over planned job cuts in steel plants in the Ruhr area
