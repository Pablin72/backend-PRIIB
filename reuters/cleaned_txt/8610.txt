KUWAIT SAYS OPEC 24 MLN BPD BELOW CEILING
  Kuwaiti oil minister Sheikh Ali
  alKhalifa alSabah said OPEC was producing well below its oil
  output ceiling and this would help prices move higher
  according to a Kuwaiti newspaper interview
      The alRai alAam newspaper quoted him as saying OPEC was
  pumping 24 mln barrels per day bpd less than its 158 mln
  bpd ceiling while consumers were drawing down their petroleum
  stocks at a rate of 45 mln bpd
      As long as OPEC maintains its output curbs demand for its
  oil will rise in April and May Sheikh Ali said adding that
  Kuwait was strongly committed to its OPEC quota
