      The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year
  operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a
  four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British
  Columbia
      BC Resources also recorded a 999 mln dlr extraordinary
  loss which included losses on disposition of North Sea oil and
  gas interests by 67 pct owned ltWestar Mining Ltd
      BC Resources 1986 extraordinary charge also included a
  writedown of its investment in Westar Petroleum Gains on the
  sales of Westar Timbers Skeena and Celgar pulp mills and
  Terrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss the
  company said
      The company said the asset sales have eliminated BC
  Resources long term financing commitment in the North Sea and
  exposure to the fluctuating pulp market
      It also said it cut long term debt in 1986 to 900 mln dlrs
  from 13 billion dlrs at yearend 1985 and management changes
