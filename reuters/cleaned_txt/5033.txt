CBT TRADERS SAY US CONSERVATION SIGNUP NEUTRAL
  The 11254837 acres of highly erodable
  farmland submitted to the US Department of Agriculture for
  the conservation reserve program was within trade guesses of
  1012 mln and should have an overall neutral impact on grain
  and soybean prices Monday grain traders said
      Farmers enrolled 1894764 acres of corn base acreage in
  the conservation program to take advantage of a corn bonus
  rental payment that was offered by the USDA which may underpin
  new crop futures they said
      New crop corn prices firmed earlier this week on ideas of a
  large signup in the program But traders noted that the poor
  yielding acres being setaside will result in only a modest
  decrease in final production figures since farmers will
  concentrate on high yielding land
      Of a total 11254837 erodoble acres submitted usda
  accepted 10572402 acres into the program at an average rental
  payment of 5117 dlrs per acre
      Farm land signed up to date now totals 19488587 acres
