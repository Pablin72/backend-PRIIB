OPEC WANTS 18 DLR OIL PRICE  OAPEC OFFICIAL
  OPEC believes world oil prices should
  be set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel OAPEC
  Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz AlWattari said today
      In a speech to a European Community ECOAPECOPEC seminar
  in Luxembourg released here AlWattari said OPEC believes
  The world energy trade should be kept without restrictions
  and should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs
      But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level had
  caused hardship for OPEC countries who had been forced to
  curtail production and he warned that such cutbacks by OPEC
  states could not be sustained in some cases
      For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is now
  considered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel its member
  countries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing
  production AlWattari said
      Such cutbacks  Cannot in certain cases be sustained
  AlWattari said As well as financial and marketing pressures
  some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use
  and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies he added
      AlWattari noted that total OPEC output was below the
  organizations agreed ceiling for all member countries in
  February although this had meant sacrifices
      The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability
  though restored to a good level was still under pressure
  AlWattari said A lasting stability in the world market
  requires a wider scope of international cooperation he added
      He said some nonOPEC oil producing countries had shown a
  political willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC
      But although cutbacks announced by these states were
  politically significant and welcomed by OPEC they were
  insufficient in terms of volume he added The overall majority
  of nonOPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPECs
  calls for supply regulation he said
      AlWattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as it
  allowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC to
  continue while not generating excessive cash flow for
  otherwise unviable highcost areas outside OPEC Such a price
  would no longer encourage protectionist measures he added
      Fadhil AlChalabi OPEC Deputy Secretary General also
  addressing the seminar added that discipline was still needed
  to prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market
      Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageous
  for both sides AlChalabi said adding he hoped cooperation
  would ultimately lead to fullfledged EuroArab dialogue
