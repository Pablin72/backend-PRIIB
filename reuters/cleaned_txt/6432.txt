MALAYSIA TO CUT OIL OUTPUT FURTHER TRADERS SAY
  Malaysias state oil company Petronas
  will cut oil production to 420000 barrels per day bpd from
  May 1 trade sources said
      Malaysia cut its 510000 bpd target output by 10 pct last
  September to support Opec moves to boost prices and the latest
  cut would reduce output by 175 pct from 1986s target level
      Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its
  10 pct production cutback until mid1987
      However the Finance Ministry said in its annual report
  that Malaysias crude oil output was expected to rise to an
  average 510000 bpd in 1987
      The ministrys forecast assumed average 1987 crude prices
  at 13 dlrsbarrel bbl but prices have risen enough to permit
  further production cutbacks the sources said
      Malaysias benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrsbbl
  this year against a low of 1050 dlrsbbl in July they said
      Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add to
  the tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reduced
  Indonesian and Chinese crude output
      The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices as
  there is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases due
  to the availability of cheaper alternatives the sources said
      In addition to term sales Petronas has been offering two
  to three 400000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each month
  for sale through tender the sources said
      However this practice is likely to dwindle given the
  reduced scale of production they said
