  28dlrpershare offering price for Caesars World Inc is
  thought to be much too low and is likely to attract other
  suitors for the hotelcasino company industry analysts said
      I think someone else will probably come in or they MTS
  will have to raise their bid said Marvin Roffman an analyst
  at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc
      MTS a company formed by Martin Sosnoff Caesars Worlds
  largest shareholder today began a tender offer valued at
  7252 mln dlrs for all shares Sosnoff doesnt already own
      I think the offer is too low by at least five points
  said Roffman who described Caesars World as the operator of
  one of the finest casinos in the world
      Sosnoff a New York investor already owns 133 pct of
  Caesars Worlds 303 mln shares
      Following news of the tender offer Caesars Worlds shares
  were trading at 2778 up 338
      A Caesars World spokesman said the company was declining
  comment on the Sosnoff move for the moment but Caesars may
  issue a public statement after it has studied the offer
      Roffman said Caesars World has considerable growth
  potential and he is forecasting fiscal 1988 earnings of two
  dlrs per share
      Caesars World owns casino hotels in Nevada and honeymoon
  resorts in Pennsylvanias Pocono Mountains It also controls
  Caesars New Jersey Inc ltCJN which owns an Atlantic City
  NJ casino hotel
      For its fiscal year ended July 31 Caesars World reported
  net income of 41 mln dlrs or 136 dlrs per primary share
      The company reported second quarter net income of 126 mln
  dlrs or 41 cts per share compared with income of 75 mln
  dlrs or 25 cts per share a year earlier
      Daniel Lee an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said
  that although Sosnoffs relatively low bid may attract other
  suitors willing to pay a higher price for Caesars there is
  little likelihood that a competing bid would start a battle for
  the company
