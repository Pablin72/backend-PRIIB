FIRST INTERSTATE ltI ESTIMATES BRAZIL RISKS
  First Interstate Bancorp said its
  1987 pretax income could be reduced by about 335 mln dlrs if
  it decides to reclassify its 339 mln dlrs in medium to
  longterm loans to Brazil as nonperforming
      But the company stressed in a filing with the Securities
  and Exchange Commission that it believes it is too soon to
  reclassify the debt despite Brazils Feb 20 suspension of
  direct interest payments on medium and longterm loans
      The corporation believes that it is premature to make a
  decsion to classify such medium and longterm debt as
  nonperforming at this time First Interstate said
      But First Interstate said that if Brazils suspension of
  interest payments continues it may have to reclassify its
  loans as nonperforming and place them on nonaccrual meaning
  that interest previously accrued but not paid would be deducted
  from net income and interest would no longer be accrued
      Besides its medium and longterm debt First Interstate
  said it also has 165 mln dlrs in shortterm loans or trade
  lines in Brazil
      As of Dec 31 1986 nonperforming Brazilian outstandings
  were about 41 mln dlrs it said
