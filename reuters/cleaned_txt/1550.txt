GERMAN INSTITUTE SEES INFLATION RISING IN 1987
  The cost of living in West Germany will
  likely be about 05 pct higher on average in 1987 than in 1986
  when the cost of living actually fell by an average 02 pct in
  the first recurrence of negative inflation since the 1950s the
  HWWA economic research institute said
      The reemergence of inflation will result mainly from the
  fading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986
  cost of living  the steep decline in both oil prices and the
  value of the dollar the institute said in a report
      The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in the
  course of 1987 but will average only 05 pct for the year as a
  whole because year on year rates will remain negative in the
  first part of 1987
      Provisional inflation figures for February released last
  week showed the cost of living last month was 05 pct lower
  than in February 1986 In January prices had fallen 08 pct
  against the same month a year earlier
      The HWWA said its forecast assumed the dollar would remain
  around 180 marks and oil prices would range between 15 and 17
  dlrs per barrel
