FRENCH SUBSIDIZED CORN FOR TUNISIAMOROCCOUSDA
  US corn sales to Tunisia Morocco
  and other North African countries may face increased
  competition from European Community EC corn sales the US
  Agriculture Department said
      In its World Production and Trade report the USDA said
  sales of French corn for nearby delivery have been confirmed
  with an export subsidy of about 145 dlrs per tonne bringing
  the French price to about 72 dlrs per tonne FOB
      While this is about the same price as US corn EC corn
  has lower transport costs the department noted
      The French sales mark the beginning of commercial EC corn
  exports which could reach 750000 tonnes to North Africa and
  the Middle East areas which have traditionally purchased their
  corn needs from the United States the department said
      Department officials said the 750000 tonnes of exports are
  for the year up to September 30 1987
      They said export licenses for about 500000 tonnes have
  been issued so far
