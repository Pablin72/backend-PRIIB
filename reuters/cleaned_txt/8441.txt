TALKING POINTWENDYS INTERNATIONAL ltWEN
  Takeover speculation buoyed Wendys
  International Incs stock even after Coca Cola Co took the
  fizz out of market rumors by denying it was an interested
  suitor
      Wendys retreated from an earlier high of 1338 and lost
  a point when Coca Cola ltKO said the rumors were untrue
  However Wendys remained up 58 at 1238 on volume of more
  than three mln shares
      Several analysts were skeptical of the rumors yet they
  said they could not conclude a takeover of the fast food
  restaurant chain was impossible
      Wendys declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds
  Yet a Wendys spokesman said the company was aware of a
  Business Week article which named Coke as a potential suitor
  and which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill
      Market sources mentioned AnheuserBusch Inc ltBUD and
  Pepsico Inc ltPEP as alternatives to Coke as acquirers Neither
  of those companies would comment nor would the Wendys
  official
      It doesnt happen every day every week every month but
  its not unusual for us to be linked with those companies said
  Denny Lynch Wendys vice president of communications
      However Lynch would not comment specifically on the
  current market rumors
      Even before Coke denied the rumors analysts had been
  skeptical of a takeover since Atlantabased Coke has stated it
  views fast food chains as customers and does not want to become
  a competitor to them
      I cant put another name on it said Kidder peabody
  analyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold up
  Wendys stock It very well could be someones interested
      But Freedman said he doesnt believe now is the right time
  for Wendys to be sold
      Theyre obviously having operational difficulties Ive
  always believed at the right price Wendys would consider an
  offer but I cant believe this is the right price at the
  right time Freedman said
      If a transaction takes place the buyers going to control
  the situation Freedman said
      I just dont think theres anything going on I dont
  think its worth much more than where it is said Joseph Doyle
  of Smith Barney
      Analysts said Wendys has suffered largely from the burger
  wars between itself McDonalds Corp ltMCD and Pillsbury Cos
  ltPSY Burger King chain Wendys the third largest fast food
  hamburger chain in the US lost about 11 pct in same store
  sales last year analysts said
      Wendys also fumbled when it introduced a highpriced
  breakfast which it has since withdrawn analysts said Some
  analysts said the company should be bringing in new products
  but it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround
      There are analysts however who believe Wendys may be
  vulnerable to a takeover
      James Murren of CJ Lawrence said Wendys could be worth
  14 to 15 dlrs on a breakup basis He said the company has
  improved its debttoequity ratio and Wendys owns a high
  percent of its own restaurants  38 pct of 3500
      They also have some attractive leaseholds on their
  restaurants Murren said
      Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year
  Wendys real sales store for store turned upwards in the
  fourth quarter That was about the first time in seven
  quarters he said
      Caroline Levy of EF Hutton also believes something could
  be going on with Wendys My gut feeling is somethings going
  to happen I dont know what she said
      She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrs
  per share
      One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitor
  because Wendys decided to sell Coke at its fountains instead
  of Pepsi
      Wendys is currently embroiled in litigation brought by
  Pepsi which holds a contract with the company analysts said
  Pepsis soda is still sold in the Wendys restaurants
