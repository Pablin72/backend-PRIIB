JAPAN BEEF PRICE SUPPORT CUT WILL NOT RAISE DEMAND
  Japans plan to cut beef intervention
  prices for the fiscal year starting April 1 will not boost
  demand because of strict supply controls and a complex
  distribution system Japanese and US Industry sources said
      Government beef policy protects farmers rather than meeting
  consumers demands and the cutback  Is too marginal a
  Housewives Association of Japan official said
      Despite mounting US Pressure on Japan to open farm
  markets beef is strictly controlled by the government which
  maintains a price stabilisation zone to protect farmers
      Under the plan expected to be announced this month the
  standard or bottom price of castrated wagyu  known as marbled
  beef  will be set at 1370 yen per kilo for 198788 against
  1400 now and the ceiling at 1780 yen against 1820
      The standard price of other beef mainly produced from
  dairy steers is set at 1020 yen against 1090 and the ceiling
  at 1325 against 1420
      Ministry officials said the semigovernment Livestock
  Industry Promotion Corp LIPC conducts buffer stock operations
  to help keep wholesale beef prices within the intervention
  price zone
      The LIPC is allowed to import most beef with the amount
  set by the government under a quota system When wholesale
  prices go above the ceiling the LIPC releases its beef stocks
  both domestic and imported and buys locally produced beef when
  prices are below
      But the LIPC has often been criticised for releasing beef
  stocks when the prices are higher than the ceiling
      Phillip Seng Asian Director of the US Meat Export
  Federation told Reuters the two pct cut in prices is a step
  toward closing the gap with European Community prices about
  half those in Japan
      But Seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or US
  Meat exporters because of Japans rigid and complicated
  distribution system and strict supply control by the LIPC
      The Housewives Association official said retail beef prices
  are high mainly because of distribution problems and high
  production costs as well as poor operations by the LIPC
      American meat packers see Japan as a promising market FC
  Beatty of US Packer John Morrell and Co told the Japan
  Times beef cuts which sell for 120 to 300 dlrs a pound in
  the US Are sold at 15 to 30 dlrs in Japan

      But industry sources said it is unclear how much demand
  will pick up if retail beef prices drop following any sharp
  reduction in intervention prices
      US Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said this week he
  will ask Japan to remove all beef import restrictions when he
  visits here next month
      In 1984 Japan decided to increase its beef import quota by
  9000 tonnes a year until March 31 1988
      In 198788 the quota will rise to 177000 tonnes from
  168000 in 198687 ministry officials said adding Japan wants
  to keep selfsufficiency in beef at around 70 pct
