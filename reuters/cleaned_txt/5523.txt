BALLADUR MAINTAINS 1987 FRENCH INFLATION TARGET
  Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said he
  was maintaining his 25 pct inflation target for 1987 after the
  announcement earlier today of a 34 pct yearonyear rise in
  retail prices for February
      He told a radio interviewer he saw no reason to revise his
  target for 1987 after the February monthly result of between
  01 to O2 pct following a 09 pct rise in January three pct
  year on year that forced the government to revise an earlier
  target of two pct to a current 25 pct
      He said he was happy with a good result for February but
  stressed a need for continued vigilance against inflation
      A Finance Ministry statement said the yearonyear
  differential between French and lower West German inflation
  rates calculated on the last three months had narrowed in
  February to two to 23 pct compared to 27 pct in January
      If calculated on the last 12 months the differential came
  to 39 pct the statement said adding The tendency is
  therefore one of a lessening of the inflation gap with our main
  trading partner
