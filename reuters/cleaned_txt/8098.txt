US CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK  MINIREFUNDING
  A hefty slice of new US Treasury
  supply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering credit
  market but at least this weeks offerings should provide it
  with some focus economists said
      Banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put to
  work so the auctions should breathe some life into the market
  said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc
      The Treasury will place a 25 billion dlr package of
  twoyear fouryear and sevenyear notes on the sales block
  this week
      The minirefunding which will raise 927 billion dlrs in
  new cash comprises 10 billion dlrs of twoyear notes for
  auction on Tuesday 775 billion dlrs of fouryear notes on
  Wednesday and 725 billion dlrs of sevenyear notes on
  Thursday The market also faces the regular weekly three and
  sixmonth bill auction today amounting to 128 billion dlrs
      The minirefunding does not come at a particularly
  auspicious time for the market Bond prices have been drifting
  sideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudy
  US Economic outlook diminished chances of a change in
  Federal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar
      Moreover the bond markets inertia has compared
  unfavourably with the rash of activity taking place in
  highyield markets overseas like the UK As well as in US
  Equities
      But according to the Merrill Lynch economists there are
  signs the pall hanging over the US Bond market is lifting a
  bit
      Customer activity has been light but all on the buyside
  and there is a marked absence of selling they said in a weekly
  report
      Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believes
  banks will snap up the two and fouryear issues at this weeks
  sales
      The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings
  Though the yield spread to the cost of carrying these
  maturities has been wider it is still positive he said in a
  weekly market review
      But economists agreed not even the auctions will generate
  enough impetus for a major move This will only come once the
  overseas markets have had their run
      Based on last weeks events there is little to indicate
  that the appetite for yield has begun to wane said economists
  at Salomon Brothers Inc
      Indeed talk persisted last week that Japanese investors
  are planning to reweight their portfolios in favour of the
  higheryielding markets at the start of Japans new fiscal year
  on April 1
      And while traditionally the Japanese have not been big
  buyers of the shorterdated issues on offer at this weeks US
  Auctions such reports undermine market confidence
      Even actions by the British Australian and Canadian
  monetary authorities to curb the rise of their currencies
  should also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bond
  markets the Salomon Brothers economists said
      Meanwhile ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven the
  US Market unless they deviate widely from expectations
  economists said
      This weeks economic calendar begins on Tuesday with
  February durable goods orders Economists expect a rebound from
  Januarys depressed levels
      Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co said
  several areas including transport equipment should have
  bounced back But a decline in military capital goods will cap
  total new orders He forecasts a rise of two pct after
  Januarys 67 pct slump Some other economists foresee a gain
  as large as five pct
      Fridays consumer price report for February is expected to
  show an increase of about 03 pct after a 07 pct January gain
  Economists said energy prices  the driving force behind the
  January rise  rose more moderately last month while food
  prices declined
      Meanwhile economists warned that the federal funds rate
  will be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to the
  approach of quarterend and the midApril tax date
      Some economists expect the Fed to execute a bill pass this
  week because its adding requirement increases sharply in the
  new statement period beginning on Thursday
      Fed funds traded at 6116 pct late Friday and are expected
  to open near that level
