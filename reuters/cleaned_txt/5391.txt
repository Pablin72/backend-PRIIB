US SOY PRODUCERS THINK EC OILS TAX UNLIKELY
  American soybean producers are
  confident the proposed European Community EC tax on vegetable
  oils and fats will be rejected but are leaving nothing to
  chance American Soybean Association ASA presidentelect
  Wayne Bennett said
      Bennett who is leading one of three soybean producer
  delegations on a lobbying tour of EC capitals was speaking at
  a lunch
      After meetings at the Economics and Foreign ministries this
  morning he said the Dutch Government had indicated it would
  vote against the proposal as had a number of other countries
      Our information suggests we will have the required number
  of votes in Brussels to prevent the tax proposal going forward
  he said
      The proposal has been talked of in Brussels for the past 20
  years and dropped every time What we want now is to kill it
  once and for all Bennett added
      Backing up the soybean producers active lobbying the US
  Government has also indicated it will be prepared to retaliate
  with penal import taxes if the proposal does get through he
  said
      The US Government also feels it has a good case to fight
  the proposed tax in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
  GATT a US Embassy spokesman said
      US Exports of soybeans and products to the EC account for
  onefifth of annual production and are worth about 25 billion
  dlrs a year Bennett said
      The proposed tax on oils and fats would hit US Producers
  badly while at the same time virtually doubling the price of
  soyoil in the EC which would suffer far worse than other
  higherpriced oils because of the nature of the proposed tax
  he added
      The revenue to the EC from the tax would simply be used to
  finance the ECs own oilseed subsidy machine he said
      We in the ASA are dedicated freetraders We helped defeat
  the Wine Equity Act two years ago but we will not stand by and
  watch our own farmers suffer from such protectionist EC
  measures Bennett said
      The mood in the US Is turning increasingly protectionist
  and the ECs actions are fueling the chances of a trade war
  he added
