TALKING POINTVIACOM INTERNATIONAL ltVIA
  A bidding war for Viacom International
  Inc one of the largest US entertainment companies pitted a
  management group and other investors against National
  Amusements Inc a closely held theater operator
      Both sides raised their bids over the weekend A source
  close to the management side insisted that timing was on his
  side He said if outside directors approve the management
  proposal a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders
  with proxy material going out late this week It would take 20
  days from the day we mail said the source
      The source predicted National Amusements controlled by
  investor Sumner Redstone would need half a year to complete
  a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must
  accompany any change in control of Viacoms broadcast licenses
  and cable television franchises
      Redstone was not available for comment
      Some of Wall Streets arbitrage players said it was a rare
  situation that could only be enjoyed  a true bidding war One
  said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and
  if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to
  the Viacom management plan he would have a chance to win
      The independent directors of Viacom were called into a
  meeting today Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow
      Viacom shares climbed 212 to 5038 by midafternoon One
  major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation We think
  were at the end now in terms of bidding said the firms
  arbitrageur who spoke on condition he not be identified
      Both Redstones proposal and the management proposal would
  create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt The
  management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 25
  billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred
  stock convertible into 45 pct of the common stock
      Redstones newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash
  a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a
  value of 750 dlrs and onefifth of a share of common stock
  stock of Arsenal Holdings representing 20 pct of the equity
  interest in the restructured Viacom One arbitrageur calculated
  the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 250 dlrs making the
  total package worth 52 dlrs per share
      Management offered 3850 dlrs in cash exchangeable
  preferred stock worth 850 dlrs and a fractional share of
  convertible preferred The arbitrageur said the equity portion
  was worth about 400 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs
      Redstones newest plan raised the amount of interest he
  would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond
  April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated The
  plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct
  during May and 12 pct thereafter Previously Redstone offered
  eight pct interest
      Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management
  group led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes
  were offering high prices Redstone really wants to own the
  company one said Another said management seemed to have the
  edge on the timing issue
      Redstones company owns 196 pct ov Viacoms 35 mln shares
      A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what
  the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth He
  noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp ltFMC which
  adopted a highly leveraged structure last year inititally
  traded at 1250 dlrs per share dipped to nine dlrs and is now
  just over 30 dlrs
      Last week Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two
  two cts per share from 23 cts The company said interest costs
  from several acquisitions affected results
      Shares of Warner Communications Inc ltWCI rose 78 to
  3118 Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 325
  mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 125 mln shares at
  3750 dlrs
      Chris Craft Industries ltCCN which owns a stake in Warner
  rose 114 to 2234
