SANTOS SAYS PROFITS HIT BY OIL PRICE FALL
  Leading Australian onshore oil and gas
  producer Santos Ltd ltSTOSS said its 1986 results were hit
  by sharp reductions in prices for crude oil condensate and
  liquefied petroleum gas LPG
      The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in net
  profit to 8867 mln dlrs from 14404 mln in 1985
      Santos chairman Sir Brian MassyGreene said in a statement
  that increased production particularly of oil and LPG along
  with reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil
  exploration and development outlays were helping Santos deal
  with an adverse business climate
      Santos said it remained financially strong with an
  injection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985
  rights issue and had cash reserves of 3813 mln dlrs at the
  end of 1986 against 4019 mln a year earlier
      It said it had also made significant progress in repaying
  debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders funds
  had fallen to 101 from 154
      Santos yesterday announced a 400 dlr a share takeover bid
  for the 9693 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas
  company ltTMOC Resources Ltd  valuing the target at 2485 mln
  dlrs
      Santos said 75 pct of its loans were US Dollar
  denominated and significant currency purchases were made during
  the year to maintain that natural hedge At year end it held
  145 mln US Dlrs enough to meet all 1987 repayments
      Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program
  finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia but oil
  exploration was less successful with 162 mln barrels added to
  reserves  less than depletion during the year
      Cooper Basin producers are committed to a twoyear scheme
  to double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget for
  oil exploration had been boosted 20 pct
      Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and
  production volumes but with extra oil exploration and
  encouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism
      But it called on the goverment to continue fostering
  domestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme
      It makes no sense to abandon this policy now when
  exploration is at its lowest level for many years and when
  Australias oil selfsufficency is expected to decline rapidly
  MassyGreen said
