USDA RAISES SOVIET GRAIN IMPORT ESTIMATE
  The US Agriculture Department
  increased its estimate of Soviet 198687 grain imports to 26
  mln tonnes from last months projection of 23 mln tonnes
      In its monthly USSR Grain Situation and Outlook USDA said
  the increase reflected the return of the Soviet Union to the
  US corn market and continued purchases of both wheat and
  coarse grain from other major suppliers
      USSR wheat imports were projected at 15 mln tonnes up one
  mln from last months estimate and 700000 tonnes below the
  preliminary 198586 figure
      Soviet grain for feed use was estimated at a record 129 mln
  tonnes Record or nearrecord livestock inventories along with
  a dry fall which likely reduced late season pasturage and a
  cold winter have increased feed demand USDA said
      USSR meat and egg production in January rose only slightly
  from the previous Januarys level while milk production
  increased by nearly six pct
      Unusually cold weather in January and smaller increases in
  roughage supplies during 1986 than in 1985 kept livestock
  production from expanding as much as it did a year earlier
