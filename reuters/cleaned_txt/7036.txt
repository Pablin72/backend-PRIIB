US CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK  SPENDING M1
  Brisk increases in personal income and
  consumption are to appear in February data released today but
  the bond markets recent sluggishness suggests there will be no
  major price reaction unless the rises are much larger than
  expected economists said
      Personal income is forecast to rise by 06 to 08 pct
  compared with no change in January while consumption
  expenditures are projected to increase 14 to 16 pct
  reversing most of the two pct drop recorded in January
      M1 money supply data for the March 9 week will also be
  released An increase of some 23 billion dlrs is expected    
      Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc
  expects a one pct rise in income led by a strong gain in wage
  and salary disbursements in February
      Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 337000 jobs in February the
  average workweek lengthened by 06 pct and hourly wages rose by
  four cts he noted in a report Vigorous spending on durable
  goods last month especially cars foreshadow a rise of at
  least 15 pct in consumption he added
      The prospect of bearish data did not trouble the bond
  market much yesterday with the 30year Treasury bond slipping
  just 732 to 992832 for a yield of 751 pct
      Analysts said the market is still trapped in a narrow
  range desperately seeking direction
      Seasonally adjusted its already December in the bond
  market quipped Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co
  International Inc
      Paul Boltz of T Rowe Price Associates Inc said the
  steadiness of long bond yields around 75 pct despite some
  signs of a stronger economy probably reflects expectations
  that inflation will remain subdued
      But he warned that this assumption might not be justified
      It took the bond market a long while to see that inflation
  was not returning to double digits and now that it has learned
  that lesson it may be a little slow to see that a four to five
  pct inflation is a real possibility ahead Boltz said in a
  report
      After trading late yesterday at 51516 pct Fed funds were
  indicated by brokers to open comfortably at 51516 six pct
