BURRBROWN ltBBRC SEES LOWER 1ST QTR EARNINGS
  BurrBrown Corp said its first
  quarter 1987 results will show profits significantly below the
  1058000 dlrs or 11 cts per share earned in the first
  quarter last year
      The company said the profit decline will be the result of
  an increase in reserves for inventory valuation The increase
  will be to cover potential writedowns of certain inventories
  or products used in compactdisc stereo systems
      BurrBrown said the possible writedown is being
  precipitated by a shift in market demand toward higher
  performance products
