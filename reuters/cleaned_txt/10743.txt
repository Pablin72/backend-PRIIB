RUGBY WELL PREPARED FOR NEW CEMENT COMPETITION
  Rugby Portland Cement Plc ltRBYLL said
  it was well placed to operate in the new circumstances
  following the ending in February of the 53year old cement
  manufacturers common price and marketing arrangements
      In a statement following the release of its 1986 results
  IT stated that the current year had started well It reported
  that pretax profits in the year rose to 3546 mln stg from
  2184 mln previously on turnover higher at 3133 mln after
  2522 mln
      The strong recovery of the first six months continued into
  the second half although UK Cement demand rose only
  modestly Results benefitted from cost cutting and higher
  volumes
      The decision by the Cement Makers Federation to end the
  pricing agreement reflected pressure from higher competition
  due to growing imports and the possibility that the system
  would be taken to the Restrictive Practices Court by the UK
  Government It stated that its John Carr unit benefitted from
  strong organic growth although overseas its Cockburn operation
  had a difficult period with high maintenance costs and
  increased depreciation charges
      The company is proposing to change its name at the next
  annual meeting to ltRugby Group Plc
      Rugby said it spent 27 mln stg on acquisitions in 1986 It
  noted that its Western Australia hotels company had agreed to
  sell the Parmelia hotel for 315 mln Australian dlrs some
  seven mln stg above end1986 book value
      The results were largely in line with forecasts and Rugby
  shares were little changed at 242p after 241 at Fridays close
