JAPAN OPENS HOME MARKET TO US FISH
  Japan has agreed to drop barriers to
  Americancaught herring and pollock opening the way for
  shipments that could reach 300 mln dlrs annually US Trade
  Representative Clayton Yeutter announced
      Yeutter said the accord was reached after extensive
  bilateral negotiations that ended earlier today in Tokyo
      He said the Commerce Department estimated US shipments of
  processed pollock products and herring should rise to 85 mln
  dlrs this year and to more than 300 mln dlrs annually in later
  years
      There was no immediate assessment of the value of current
  US shipments but officials said the pact would lift quotas
  to the point that Americans would be able to ship nearly all
  the pollock and herring ordered by Japanese firms
      At the same time Yeutter said Washington was temporarily
  suspending a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs
  and Trade GATT that Japan was unfairly curbing imports of the
  two fish
      He said the complaint would be reviewed later this year
  after an assessment to see if Japan lived up to the agreement
