ATPC MEMBERS FIND WAYS TO CURB TIN EXPORTS
  Mine and industry officials from
  most member states of the Association of Tin Producing
  Countries ATPC say they have found ways to limit group
  exports to 96000 tonnes in the year started March 1 according
  to views polled by Reuter correspondents
      The plan to curb exports agreed in January is aimed at
  cutting the world surplus to 50000 tonnes from 70000 now and
  boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16
      Members of the sevenmember Kuala Lumpurbased ATPC account
  for some 65 pct of the worlds tin output
      Under the ATPC plan Malaysia has been allocated an export
  quota of 28526 tonnes Indonesia 24516 Thailand 19000
  Bolivia 13761 Zaire 1736 and Nigeria 1461
      Australia has said it is not setting any export quota
  However the tonnage allocated to it 7000 tonnes is roughly
  equal to its expected output this year
      Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable
      Mine officials in Malaysia the worlds leading producer
  said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that
  output is limited to around 31500 tonnes in the year started
  March 1
      Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters that
  excess output of some 3000 tonnes after exports of 28500 in
  the oneyear quota period would be kept in the national stock
      Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curb
  and asked the government not to issue new mining licences More
  than 100 applications for licences are pending
      Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mining
  licences only if a sixmonth review of production trends showed
  that local mines were not overproducing
      ATPC chairman and Indonesias Mining and Energy Minister
  Subroto has pledged his countrys support for the export curb
      A spokesman for the stateowned tin mining company PT
  Tambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia to
  stick to an export quota of 24516 tonnes because this was
  close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24636
      In Bangkok Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said
  Thailand would keep to its 19000 tonne quota and added this
  would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices
      To insure adherence the industry ministry and sole tin
  exporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encourage
  bigger stockpiles and income tax exemptions would be
  permitted he said
      The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected to
  disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive
  production industry sources said
      But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong told
  Reuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo
  Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines
      Thailand exported 18367 tonnes in 1986 up from 17359 in
  1985 Pramual said
      Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year than
  its allocated 13761 tonne quota
      Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Paz
  that Bolivia expected to export about 9000 tonnes of tin in
  calendar 1987
      He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of
  October 1985 of about 20000 of the 28000 workers at the state
  mining company Comibol which produces more than 80 pct of
  Bolivias total exports
      He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exports
  but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be
  achieved He did not elaborate
      Mines Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in
  Lagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its
  ATPC quota of 1461 tonnes because its metals output had
  declined due to poor demand and high production costs
      Industry sources told Reuters that Nigerias output was
  less than 1000 tonnes last year
      ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries
  export figures every three months using customs documents and
  make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to
  be breached within the yearlong quota period
      The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to
  breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures
      They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil
  their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other
  members at the ATPCs discretion
      The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated
  106000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan
      Nonmembers Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with
  the ATPC and limit their exports to 21000 and 7000 tonnes
  respectively during the quota period
