SAUDI ARABIAS KING FAHD WANTS STABLE OIL PRICES
  King Fahd said today Saudi Arabia wants
  oil price stability and he called on nonOPEC producers to
  avoid harmful competition with the 13 nation group
      His plea in an interview with Reuters and the television
  news agency Visnews came ahead of a state visit he will make
  to Britain later this month
      King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be prepared
  to reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4133 mln
  barrels per day bpd to defend the 18 dlr benchmark price
  agreed to by OPEC last December
      The King replied Saudi Arabia doesnt decide prices by
  itself but certainly desires price stability
      NonOPEC countries must help us in a framework of common
  interest so that there is no type of competition which could
  prove harmful to everyone he said
      Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a first
  step towards higher world oil prices King Fahd said it was not
  for Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine such
  issues Iran and Algeria have already called for a higher
  benchmark
      In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure
  due partly to quota violations by some OPEC members King Fahd
  said Saudi Arabia the worlds largest oil exporter was
  adhering to decisions made at OPECs December conference which
  set a 158 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987
      A major nonOPEC producer Britain has so far resisted the
  groups pleas to curb its North Sea oil output
      The King also urged the world community to help the
  Palestinians return to their homeland and called for a peaceful
  end to the IranIraq war The 612yearold war could not be
  resolved on the battlefield he said
