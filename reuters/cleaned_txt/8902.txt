STANDARD CHARTERED BOOSTED BADDEBT PROVISIONS
  Standard Chartered Plc ltSTCHL faced
  with a recession in the key Singapore and Malaysian markets and
  an ongoing depression in the shipping industry boosted its
  baddebt provisions in 1986 chairman Lord Barber said
      Barber said in a statement on the banks 1986 results that
  bad and doubtful debt provisions both general and specific
  stood at 5456 mln stg against 4166 mln at end1985
      Bank figures showed the increase was almost exclusively in
  the specific bad risk provision which qualifies for UK Tax
  breaks New specific provisions rose by 1115 mln stg while
  712 mln stg were reallocated from the general risk provision
      In all a 1842 mln stg charge was made against profits for
  1986 compared with a 1007 mln stg charge in 1985 Total
  pretax profits fell to 254 mln after 268 mln in 1985
      The continuing serious recessionary conditions in Singapore
  and Malaysia and the depressed condition of the shipping
  industry made it necessary to provide heavily against bad and
  doubtful debs arising from loans in the Asia Pacific region on
  top of the normal level of provisioning Barber said
      He said the decision was also taken to build up loan loss
  reeserves by making a sizeable increase in the charges for
  general provisions for commercial and cross border risks
      Barber said due to baddebt provisioning the Asia Pacific
  region made a negligible contribution to pretax profits
      He said the profits contribution from the UK Businesses
  was well maintained although the reported result was affected
  by cross border debt provisioning while Californian subsidiary
  Union Bank showed continued growth
      Tropical Africa Middle East and South Asia all turned in
  excellent performances and the revival in Europe continued he
  said
      Barber said the group which succesfully fought off a
  takeover bid by Lloyds Bank ltLLOYL last year strengthened
  its capital resources during that year to just over three
  billion stg while total assets increased to 322 billion
      Capital adequacy ratios remained strong with the primary
  capital ratio standing at 75 pct at end 1986 he said
