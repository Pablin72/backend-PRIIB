JAPAN ACTS TO COOL US ANGER ON TELECOMS DISPUTE
  Japan has sought to assure the US It is
  not trying to keep foreign equity in a new Japanese
  international telecommunications company below the legal limit
  of 33 pct a Post and Telecommunications ministry official
  said
      In a letter sent yesterday Postal Minister Shunjiro
  Karasawa told US Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige that the
  ministry does not object to foreign participation by those US
  Firms that have expressed interest
      But it does oppose any foreign international
  telecommunications carrier having a management role he said
      The move appears to be an effort to dampen US Opposition
  to the planned merger of two rival firms seeking to compete
  with the current monopoly ltKokusai Denwa Denshin Co Ltd and
  to reduce the share held in any KDD rival by UKs Cable and
  Wireless Plc ltCAWLL industry analysts and diplomats said
      One of the rival firms ltInternational Telecom Japan Inc
  ITJ has offered a stake in the company to eight US Firms
  including General Electric Co ltGE Ford Motor Co ltF and
  Citibank NA ltCCI and two European companies ITJ president
  Nobuo Ito said yesterday
      Cable and Wireless holds a 20 pct share in a second
  potential KDD rival ltInternational Digital Communications
  Planning Inc along with ltC Itoh and Co Merrill Lynch and Co
  Inc ltMER and Pacific Telesis International Inc ltPAC both of
  the US Hold three and 10 pct shares respectively
      The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has urged the
  merger of the two firms because it says the market can only
  support a single KDD competitor
      It has also rejected management participation by an
  international common carrier such as Cable and Wireless
  arguing no international precedent for such a stake exists
      Cable and Wireless Director of Corporate Strategy Jonathan
  Solomon yesterday again told ministry officials he opposes a
  merger proposal that would limit Cable and Wireless share to
  less than three pct and total foreign participation to about 20
  pct the ministry official said
      Channeling the US Firms into a single merged competitor
  would most probably result in diluting Cable and Wireless
  share industry analysts said
      Eventually the ministry will get what it wants  one
  combined competitor Bache Securities Japan Ltd analyst
  Darrell Whitten said
      Political  Leverage may get the total foreign share up
  to a certain amount but you wont find any one company with an
  extraordinarily large holding Whitten said
      Western diplomatic sources were more blunt
      They the ministry dont want to see Cable and Wireless
  with a reasonable share and they think of all sorts of
  strategies to reduce that share one said
      Fumio Watanabe a senior Keidanren a leading business
  organization official who has been trying to arrange the
  merger will present a new outline of his proposal on Thursday
  the ministry official said
