UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDS EC SUGAR TENDER RESULTTRADE
  Considerable uncertainty surrounds the
  outcome of todays EC white sugar tender traders here said
  noting it remains overshadowed by European operator threats to
  move over 800000 tonnes of sugar into intervention
      They said that due to the dispute between the Commission
  and producers over the issue it is not clear whether the
  Commission will authorise any exports at all or grant licences
  on a large tonnage
      The subsidy is seen being set above 4500 Ecus per 100
  kilos although traders are reluctant to predict a precise
  level after prices fell yesterday
      Earlier traders in Paris said they expected the Commission
  to award licences for around 50000 tonnes of white sugar with
  a maximum export rebate of 4575 to 460 Ecus
      Last week the Commission granted licences to end August on
  60500 tonnes of whites at a maximum rebate of 44819
