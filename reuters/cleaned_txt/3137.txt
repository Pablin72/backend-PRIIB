UK MONEY RATES FALL AS BANK APPROVES BASE RATE CUT
  A half point cut in base lending rates
  was announced by the big four clearing banks today after the
  Bank of England finally endorsed such a move following weeks of
  downward pressure dealers said
      During its routine intervention in the market the bank
  trimmed the rates at which it deals with the discount houses by
  half a point and National Westminster led the other clearing
  banks in reducing its base rate to 1012 pct from 11 pct
      The timing of the Bank of England move took operators by
  surprise after its recent action seemingly designed to dampen
  hopes of a base rate cut ahead of the UK Budget on March 17
         For some time fundamentals have
  led the market to push for a one point cut in base lending
  rates to 10 pct but the central bank has declined to follow
  wholesale money market rates down
      Although political considerations  the governments wish
  to see a fall in base rates coincide with the Budget  had
  been suggested by operators last week as reasons for the Banks
  delaying action worries about the real strength of sterling
  and perhaps about the markets reaction to the content of the
  Budget may have been behind the central banks caution dealers
  said
      In the event sterling continued firm after the rate cut
  leaving the market still looking for another half point fall
      Consequently rates in the money market eased during the
  day onemonth interbank sterling shedding 516 point to
  10916 716 and threemonths trading 116 point down at
  10516 316 pct Sterling cds were similarly down between
  516 point in one month and 18 point in one year
      Overnight interbank money for tomorrow was indicated at
  around 11 pct almost a point below the levels ruling at the
  end of last week Today overnight touched a high of some
  1134 pct after the Bank took out 228 mln stg of an estimated
  300 mln stg shortage
