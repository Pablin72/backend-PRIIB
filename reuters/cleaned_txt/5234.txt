BOND DEFERS RIGHTS ISSUE MULLS PROJECT PARTNERS
  ltBond Corp International Ltd a
  subsidiary of the Australianbased Bond Corp Holdings Ltd
  ltBONAS said it would defer its planned rights issue but
  still wants the issue to be made before July 31
      No date has been set for the issue announced in January
      In a document to shareholders Bond Corp said the delay
  follows its receipt of a 240 mln HK Dlr loan from its parent
  company to meet the first payment on the newly acquired Bond
  Centre commercial complex in central Hong Kong
      It also wants outside partners to take up to 50 pct in the
  project the company said
      The January announcement said the rights issue would
  finance Bond Corps 14 billion dlr acquisition of a 2377 pct
  stake in HKTVB Ltd ltTVBHHK from film magnate Run Run Shaw
      The company then reached an agreement with a consortium led
  by Sino Land Co Ltd ltSINOHK to buy a commercial complex that
  is still under construction for 19 billion dlrs
      Bond International said in the document that except for the
  240 mln dlr loan the deal would be financed from internal
  resources and by selling an interest in the building
      The payments must be completed by the end of 1987
      Bond International has also sold several residential
  buildings in Hong Kongs midlevels district for a total of
  6835 mln dlrs the statement said
      The flats were among the properties it bought last year
  from Hongkong Land Co Ltd ltHKLDHK for 14 billion dlrs
      Analysts said Bond International is heavily geared as it
  has relied on bank borrowings to purchase both the Hongkong
  Land properties and the HKTVB shares
      Bond International also said in the document that while it
  plans to sell an interest in the complex it will hold the
  HKTVB shares as a longterm investment
