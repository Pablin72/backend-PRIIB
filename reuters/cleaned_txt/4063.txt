INDONESIAN COFFEE PRODUCTION MAY FALL THIS YEAR
  Indonesias coffee production in
  198687 ending September 30 may fall slightly from last years
  level of 360000 tonnes Dharyono Kertosastro chairman of the
  Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters told Reuters
      He said shade trees had been damaged by pests and this may
  have affected the crop though it remains to be seen how
  seriously Indonesias main crop is harvested next month
      He gave no figure for expected output except to say it
  would probably be down a little from 198586 He said stocks
  were about normal at 90000 tonnes
      Kertosastro predicted that exports were unlikely to rise
  much from last years level of 320000 tonnes I expect exports
  will be a bit more maybe 330000 tonnes but not above that
  he said Exports in 198586 were valued at 944 mln US Dlrs
  but the value could fall by 30 pct this year because of low
  prices he added
      Dharyono said production was behind a five year plan target
  of 420000 tonnes for the current year but Indonesia is trying
  to boost output through introduction of higher yielding seeds
  better training for farmers and increased use of fertilizers
