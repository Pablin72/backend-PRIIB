ICI ltICI SEEKS GAINS IN SPECIALTY BUSINESSES
  Imperial Chemical Industries PLC the
  largest chemical company in the United Kingdom will expand its
  specialty chemicals and drug businesses this year and better
  its 1986 results said chairmanelect Denys Henderson
      We expect to shift our company toward higher valueadded
  businesses and continue to broaden our base Henderson told
  reporters at an informal meeting here
      ICI today announced the formation of a new US
  drug company ICI Pharma which with its Stuart
  Pharmaceuticals unit it said will double its current
  pharmaceutical sales to 11 billion dlrs by 1990
      Henderson said Our pharmaceutical business gets lost in
  the way that Glaxos Glaxo Holdings PLC does not
      ICIs pharmaceutical division is the second largest drug
  maker behind Glaxo in the UK Last year US drug sales were
  about 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 15 billion dlrs
  which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total profits
      He estimated that by 1990 ICIs pharmaceutical division
  would account for about 30 pct of total company profits
      The drug division far and away brings in the highest rate
  of return said AW Clements finance director of ICI who
  was also at the meeting
      Henderson said the new US drug concern would basically
  act as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugs
  to doctors ICI will hire 145 new salespeople by October one
      Henderson said the major new products in the companys
  pipeline expected to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrs
  annually were Statil a treatment for diabetic complications
  Zoladex a treatment for advanced prostate cancer and Carwin
  a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure
      Henderson said US Food and Drug Administration approval
  to market Statil and Zoladex both under joint licensing
  agreements with Merck and Co Inc ltMRK is not expected until
  about 1989 ICI expects to file for permission to market Carwin
  in the US later this year
      Henderson said the companys 1987 results would top 1986
  income of 888 mln dlrs or 545 dlrs per ADR on sales of 15
  billion dlrs but he declined to specify by how much
      Henderson said 1987s results would be boosted by Glidden
  Paints which ICI bought last November for 580 mln dlrs from a
  unit of Hanson Industries Inc
      Henderson also said that ICI has about nine billion dlrs
  available for acquisitions Last year the company made 40
  acquisitions the largest being Glidden He said that more
  acquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out an
  acquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as too expensive
      Henderson said that in his new role of chairman effective
  April one when he takes over from Sir John HarveyJones who
  will retire the biggest challenge ahead lay in continuing the
  earnings momentum ICI has established over the past few years
  after restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses
