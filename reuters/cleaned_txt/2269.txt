FEBRUARY US RETAIL SALES NOT SIGN OF UPTURN
  US retailers posted stronger than
  expected sales in February but not enough to prompt analysts
  to change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for the
  first half of 1987
       My feeling is that it February borrowed some of the
  business we normally see later in the quarter and the real
  strength of general merchandise sales will be in the second
  half of 1987 said Bear Stearns and Co analyst Monroe
  Greenstein
      I dont think March will be as strong because Easter falls
  in April this year said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb
     Analysts generally average the sales results of March and
  April to account for the variation of Easters occurrence
      Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said
  sales for February rose between six and 65 pct compared to a
  36 pct increase last year
       Analysts noted that February is considered a small
  transitory month between winter and spring
      In addition sales comparisons were boosted by an
  especially soft February last year which was adversely affected
  by severe weather
      Apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales
  according to retailers and analysts
      Februarys strong sales reflected a lot of fresh
  merchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due to
  tax reductions said Greenstein of Bear Stearns
      Analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales of
  durable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuing
  high levels of consumer debt
       May Department Stores Co ltMAY and K Mart Corp ltKM were
  among the strong performers posting comparable store sales
  gains of 94 pct and 82 pct respectively May had an overall
  sales gain of 150 pct and K Mart had a 131 pct sales gain 
  last month
      Favorable consumer response to our merchandise programs
  continued to positively impact our sales comparisons IN
  addition to the strong contribution by K Mart stores all our
  specialty retailing companies had excellent February sales
  said K Mart chairman Bernard Fauber
      Sears Roebuck and Co ltS posted a 49 pct increase
  Domestic sales were led by better than average increases in
  apparel home fashions and hardware and especially strong
  catalog sales said Sears chairman Edward Brennan
      Analysts were a little disappointed by JC Penney Co Inc
  ltJCP which started out with especially strong sales early in
  the month Penney posted a 55 pct increase on a comparitive
  store basis and a 53 pct gain in overall sales
      Penney chairman William Howell said store sales were
  strongest during the early part of the month while catalog
  demand was consistently strong throughout the period
      Store sales activity varied throughout the country ranging
  from good in the East to weak in the depressed southwest
      Analysts also said gross profit margins were high as
  retailers were not overly promotional due to leaner inventories
  than a year ago
      February is not a big month seasonally but these numbers
  suggest a fairly good trend for consumer spending said Drexel
  Burnham Lambert analyst Jeff Edelman
