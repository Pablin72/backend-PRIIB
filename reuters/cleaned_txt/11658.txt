US OFFICIAL SEES EVIDENCE OF EXPORT GROWTH
  Beryl Sprinkel chairman of the
  White House Council of Economic Advisers said he sees growing
  but incomplete evidence that US export volumes are finally
  strengthening
      In remarks prepared for a speech today in Los Angeles
  Sprinkel said the decline in the dollars value since 1985 had
  largely restored US cost competitiveness in world markets and
  appeared to signal an end to US trade imbalances
      I am confident that further improvements in our trade
  performance will contribute significantly to US growth in
  1987 he said
