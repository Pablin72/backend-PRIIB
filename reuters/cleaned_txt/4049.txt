ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT  MITSUBISHI HEAVY FIGHTS BACK
  International efforts to redirect Japans
  exportdriven economy toward domestic consumption face heavy
  going if the countrys largest defence contractor and worlds
  biggest shipbuilder is anything to go by
      Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd ltMITHT MHI which began
  making ships and iron goods for Japans military rulers 130
  years ago is responding to the strong yen by redoubling its
  efforts to maintain its share of export markets
      If we sell the best quality and the cheapest products
  everyone will buy them MHI president Yotaro Iida said
      Although two of MHIs main businesses shipbuilding and
  power plant construction have been hit hard by the yens 40
  pct rise against the dollar the company has no plans to
  abandon them Iida told Reuters in an interview
      Its other big activity aircraft component manufacture has
  performed so well that MHI now accounts for half of the money
  Tokyo spends on defence procurement each year
      We have made the utmost efforts among the worlds
  manufacturers to improve productivity he said You may be
  surprised if you come to see our plants The outside is old but
  the inside is ultramodern with robots and computers
      Securities analysts at major securities houses agreed that
  MHI has pared costs more quickly than its competitors The
  company has slashed its workforce to 47000 from 86000 in
  1976
      Despite its costcutting MHI expects profits to drop 40
  pct to 30 billion yen in the current fiscal year ending March
  31 from 198586s record 5014 billion
      And that includes gains from the sale of MHIs stake in
  Mitsubishi Motors Corp ltMIMTT for 49 billion yen
      Iida is optimistic about the future however He said a
  resurgence of demand from the Middle East following the recent
  recovery in oil prices coupled with persistent demand for power
  plants in developing countries will help MHI restore its
  exportstosales ratio to the past decades average of 30 pct
      MHIs exportstosales ratio fell to 259 pct in the
  halfyear ended last September from 35 to 36 pct five years
  ago
      China is the most promising market although MHI also
  considers other nonoilproducing developing countries as major
  customers
      Our customers are all seen as being in trouble due to a
  lack of foreign currency Iida said But he added that he felt
  MHI could sell to those markets with Japanese government
  financial support
      It can also finance the plants itself and recover its
  investment through product sales a strategy Iida said could
  prove popular in the future
      In shipping MHI is fighting back against lowpriced South
  Korean competition by building more technologically advanced
  carriers to carry liquefied natural gas and other products
  difficult to transport
      Shipbuilders Association officials told Reuters MHI is the
  worlds largest shipbuilder in terms of orders and capacity
      Domestically MHI is involved in 12 national projects
  including development of nuclear fusion reactors and launch
  vehicles for manmade satellites
      It has been the biggest contractor for the Japan Defence
  Agencys F15 and F14 jet fighters and missiles although all
  of these have been built under licence from US Firms
      MHI is now heading up five Japanese companies seeking to
  develop the countrys own fighter plane to replace the
  currently used F1 support fighters in the late 1990s
      Military experts said Washington is putting strong pressure
  on Tokyo to buy a US Plane either the McDonnell Douglas Corp
  F18 or General Dynamics Corp F16 to reduce Japans huge
  trade surplus with the US
      It might be a good idea to jointly produce planes with US
  Makers as Japan is supported by the US Defence umbrella Iida
  said
      MHI also plans to cooperate with the US In its Strategic
  Defence Initiative space defence program by participating in
  the project when it moves from the research stage he said
      The US Has been seeking Japans technological support
      In fiscal 198586 aircraft accounted for 171 pct of MHIs
  sales shipbuilding 17 pct and power plants 279 pct Iida said
  the ideal ratio is power plants 30 pct aircraft and special
  vehicles 25 pct and shipbuilding 15 pct
      As for the remaining 30 pct Iida said he wanted to shift
  the domestic focus away from heavy machinery sold to
  manufacturers and towards household goods but he declined to
  specify which products
      By the end of this year you may find our brand name on
  your daily products although this does not mean we will run
  away from our mainstream business he said
