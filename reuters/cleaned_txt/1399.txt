SOUTH AFRICA CORN EXPORTS COULD BE REDUCEDUSDA
  Despite earlier optimistic
  indications the South African corn crop is at a critical stage
  in its development and recent reports of heat stress could
  reduce production and therefore exportable supplies the US
  Agriculture Department said
      In its report on Export Markets for US Grains the
  department said South Africas corn exports in the 198687
  OctSept season are estimated at 25 mln tonnes up 40 pct
  from the previous year
      The reemergence of South Africa as a competitor follows a
  period of severe droughts which at one point required South
  Africa to import 27 mln tones of US corn in 198384 it
  said
      Since those imports in 198384 the US has been facing
  increased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan
      But if South Africa is perceived as lacking available
  supplies purchases of US corn may be further stimulated the
  department said
