  billion riyals

  6745 billion riyals down by about 30 pct on the 198586
  projected revenue of 97 billion
      The government failed to publish a 198687 budget due to
  uncertainty surrounding oil revenues
      Sheikh AbdulAziz said that during that year the government
  decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to
  onetwelfth of the previous fiscal years allocations minus 15
  pct
      He urged heads of government departments and public
  institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure He
  did not say how the 198788 budget shortfall would be covered
      Sheikh AbdulAziz said plans to limit expenditure in
  198687 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on
  the countrys foreign reserves
      He added in 198788 some 2766 billion riyals had been
  allocated for major projects including housing and public
  buildings social services health education transport and
  communications electricity and water industry and
  agriculture

  security There was also no projection for oil revenue
      Qatar an OPEC member has an output ceiling of 285000
  barrels per day
      Sheikh AbdulAziz said Our expectations of positive signs
  regarding oil price trends foremost among them OPECs
  determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its
  wealth have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming
  years revenue on the basis of our assigned quota
