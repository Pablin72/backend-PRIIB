BRAZIL TRADE SURPLUS RISES IN FEBRUARY
  The trade surplus doubled in
  february to 261 mln dlrs from Januarys 129 mln but was  below
  the 628 mln of February 1986 official figures show
      The director of the Banco do Brasils foreign trade
  department CACEX Roberto Fendt told reporters the upturn in
  February confirmed a rising trend in exports which totalled
  153 billion dlrs against 126 billion in January and after
  excluding coffee and oil derivitives was only slightly below
  the same month last year
      Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mln
  in February 1986 because of lower prices he added
      Fendt said that although the February results were lower
  than the average expected for the rest of the year the
  governments target of an eightbilliondlr surplus for 1987
  should be achieved This would compare with a 1986 surplus of
  95 billion dlrs
      Exports this year are expected to total 225 billion dlrs
  and imports 145 billion he added In 1986 exports totalled
  224 billion dlrs and imports 129 billion
      Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 127 billion
  dlrs from 112 billion in February last year was in line with
  government plans to foster economic growth
      Fendt said that imports were running at levels well above
  the traditional average for Brazil
      In the first two months of the year imports excluding oil
  and wheat totalled 18 billion dlrs against 147 billion in
  the same 1986 period
      This rise in import demand reflected the needs of Brazilian
  industry to equip to raise production and is perfectly
  compatible with the governments program for economic growth
  Fendt added
