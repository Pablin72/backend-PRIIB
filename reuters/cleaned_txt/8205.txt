USAIR ltU CUTS PIEDMONT ltPIE SHARES SOUGHT
  USAir Group Inc said it has amended
  its 69 dlr per share tender offer for shares of Piedmont
  Aviation Inc to reduce the maximum number it will accept to
  9309394 Previously it had sought all shares
      In a newspaper advertisement USAir said the offer and
  withdrawal rights have not been extended and will still expire
  April 3 along with the new proration period
      On Friday the US Department of Transportation approved
  USAirs acquisition of 51 pct of Piedmont If USAir were to
  acquire more than 51 pct in the tender it would be required to
  sell the excess within one week
      USAir said receipt of the 9309394 shares  which is also
  the minimum amount it will accept  would give it a total of
  about 61 pct of Piedmont shares currently outstanding and 501
  pct on a fully diluted basis
      The company said even if the purchase of the 9309394
  Piedmont shares caused it to exceed the 51 pct limit USAir
  would waive the condition to the offer that the Transportation
  Department approve a voting trust agreement permitting USAir to
  buy and hold shares under the offer pending review of USAirs
  application to gain control of Piedmont subject to the order
  not being rescinded or modified in an adverse way
