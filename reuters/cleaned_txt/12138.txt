  tender their shares only to CTCs previously reported offer for
  49 pct of Canadian Tire common shares

  Canadian Tire common It added that it extended its offer to
  May 11 at a fixed price of 16536 dlrs a share

  know by May 11 if it would obtain approval to appeal a
  previously reported Ontario court ruling upholding a regulatory
  decision to block CTCs offer

  Securities Commission because the offer excluded holders of
  Canadian Tire class A nonvoting shares which make up about 96
