CSR BIDS 220 DLRS A SHARE FOR PIONEER SUGAR MILLS
  CSR Ltd ltCSRAS said it will offer 220
  dlrs cash each for the shares it does not already hold in
  ltPioneer Sugar Mills Ltd
      CSR already holds 3174 pct of Pioneers 9980 mln issued
  shares it said in a statement
      The offer price values the entire Pioneer Sugar share
  capital at 2196 mln dlrs and compares with todays closing
  market level of 185 dlrs a share
      CSR said it will announce further details of the offer
  soon including an alternative offer of CSR shares for Pioneer
  Sugar stock
      It said the offer is generous since it will give Pioneer
  Sugar shareholders a price equivalent to 29 times Pioneers net
  earnings last financial year and a premium of 22 pct over
  yesterdays market price which CSR said it believed already
  contained an element of takeover speculation
      It also gives a premium of 91 pct over Pioneers last
  reported net tangible assets per share CSR said
      CSR said the generous offer price reflects the cost savings
  which will flow from integrated management of CSRs and
  Pioneers raw sugar mills and building materials businesses
      These economies can only be achieved through CSR control
  and management of Pioneer Sugar it added
      The takeover announcement came soon after CSRs earlier
  reported statement that it will sell its ltDelhi Petroleum Pty
  Ltd unit to an Exxon Corp ltXON unit for 985 mln dlrs and not
  proceed with the previously announced float of part of Delhi
