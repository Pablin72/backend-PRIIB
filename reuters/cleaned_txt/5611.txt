US SENATOR UNCOMMITTED ON OFFERING 092 BILL
  Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana
  ranking Republican on the US Senate Agriculture Committee
  has not decided whether to introduce an administrationbacked
  bill to apply the socalled 092 provision to 1988 through 1990
  grain crops an aide to the senator said
      The Reagan administration has asked Lugar to offer the
  measure the aide said
      However a number of farm groups have told Lugar they
  oppose the proposal on the grounds it would reopen the 1985
  farm bill and the senator has decided to take a second look at
  the proposal the aide said
      Last week the aide indicated Lugar was planning to offer
  the 092 measure and a bill to tighten a payment limitation
  loophole
