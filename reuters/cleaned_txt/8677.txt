BUNDESBANK ALLOCATES 65 BILLION MARKS IN TENDER
  The Bundesbank accepted bids for 65
  billion marks at todays tender for a 28day securities
  repurchase pact at a rate of 380 pct a central bank spokesman
  said
      Banks which bid for a total 86 billion marks liquidity
  will be credited with the funds allocated tomorrow and must buy
  back securities pledged on April 22
      The allocation was in line with market expectations the
  Bundesbank would provide more than the 34 billion marks
  draining from this week as an earlier facility expires
      Call money fell to 36070 pct ahead of the allocation from
  37585 pct yesterday dealers said
      The excess allocation compensates for public funds leaving
  the system which the Bundesbank added last week via
  governmentowned banks
      However major tax payments by banks on behalf of customers
  drew to a close this week lessening the need for liquidity
      The call money declines surprised some dealers who
  speculated it was because the Bundesbank disbursed further
  government funds today However most said this had not
  occurred
      Banks were well stocked with liquidity having 471 billion
  marks in minimum reserves at the Bundesbank on Friday up from
  499 billion on Thursday Average daily reserves over the first
  20 days of the month fell to 526 billion from 531 billion
  For all of March banks would be required to hold net daily
  average reserves of 507 billion marks dealers said
