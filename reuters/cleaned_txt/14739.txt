CANADIANS URGE EXEMPTION FROM US TRADE BILL
  A group of Canadian lawmakers from
  Ontario today asked their US counterparts to exempt Canada
  from the mandatory trade retaliation provisions in a major
  trade bill being considered by the US Congress
      At a meeting of the NortheastMidwest Coalition an
  organization of US legislators David Cooke chairman of the
  Ontario Parliaments Select Committee on Economic Affairs said
  the exemption would help trade relations
      The trade legislation to be considered by the full House in
  late April would require President Reagan to retaliate against
  foreign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions would
  harm the US economy
      Currently Reagan can reject trade sanctions on any
  grounds
      Cooke a member of the Liberal party told the US
  congressmen I can understand the trade bill I think it has
  to do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world
      I would suggest to you that we are your best friends You
  do not have those concerns with Canada and you should sincerely
  consider exempting our country from that bill he added
      Canada is the United States largest trading partner with
  twoway trade more than 113 billion dlrs in 1985 according to
  the coalition But the US ran up a 23 billion dlr deficit in
  manufactured goods that year compared to a 14 billion dlr
  surplus in services trade with its neighbour
