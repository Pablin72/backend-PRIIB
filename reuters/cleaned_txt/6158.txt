BANK OF FRANCE SEES CONTINUED INDUSTRIAL PICKUP
  The Bank of France expects a continued
  revival in shortterm industrial activity but the outlook for
  any improvement in Frances record 109 pct unemployment rate
  remains bleak the Bank of France said in its monthly review
      The upturn in activity in all industrial sectors except the
  agrofood sector in February more than compensated for the fall
  in January while construction and civil engineering
  experienced a recovery which appears likely to extend over the
  next few months
      Internal demand rose and the export situation improved in
  particular toward the European Community EC the Bank said
      Stocks decreases and order book levels with the exception
  of the agrofood industry improved substantially
      In addition retail prices and salaries stabilised last
  months
      Production rose in all sectors except agricultural
  machinery and aeronautics where it stabilised and ship
  construction where it declined
      The car industry was the major beneficiary of the upturn in
  activity in February with both domestic and export orders
  rising
      In the consumer goods sector actitity rose sharply despite
  a fall in the household goods sector and stability in
  pharmaceuticals
      Among semifinished products output rose sharply helped
  by a strong growth in construction materials
      But activity in the retail sector declined slightly over
  the past two months
