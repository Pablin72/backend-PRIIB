SOUTH AFRICAN MAIZE ESTIMATE CALLED CONSERVATIVE
  The South African governments
  maize production estimate of 78 mln tonnes for the current
  year is rather too conservative leading grain and produce
  merchants Kahn and Kahn Pty Ltd said
      The company in a detailed report estimated the harvest as
  high as 83 mln tonnes and said if this forecast is met the
  ostensible surplus for export will be approximately 225 mln
  tonnes
      This paradoxically is creating a problem for the Maize
  Board Kahn and Kahn said
      It said the maize export price currently is depressed and
  the board is probably confronted with the necessity to maintain
  or slightly increase the internal price of maize againTo
  offset the ostensible loss which must be faced on exporting
  surplus amounts
