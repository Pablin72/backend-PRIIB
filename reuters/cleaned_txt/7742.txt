TALKING POINTFIRST CITY BANCORPORATION ltFBT
  First City Bancorporations sale of 54
  mln dlrs in oil loans to PrudentialBache should significantly
  reduce its energy problems but the banks losses are still
  virtually guaranteed to continue analysts said
      The package of energy loans was sold at book value so
  First City did not to show a gain or loss said bank spokesman
  James Day He added it was possible First City would sell more
  of the banks remaining 14 billion dlrs in oilrelated loans
  to raise cash
      The loans had been made by First City to oil producers and
  to oilfield service and supply companies Day said some had
  already been classified as nonperforming or charged off as a
  loss but he could not identify how many were included in those
  categories
      The loans were purchased by Prudential Baches Energy
  Growth Fund a limited partnership created last month with 90
  mln dlrs in funding to invest in oil and gas properties
      First City the big Texas bank hit hardest by the downturn
  in oil prices lost a record 402 mln dlrs in fiscal year 1986
  and has said it is seeking a merger partner or some other
  capital assistance The Houstonbased banks nonperforming
  assets totaled 8971 mln dlrs at yearend up from 5631 mln
  dlrs at the end of 1985
      Analysts have said no buyer is likely to be interested in
  the troubled bank unless government assistance is available
      Their problems are not just limited to energy They have a
  substantial portfolio in real estate This sale in and of
  itself wont make the company look better to a potential
  buyer said Ray Archibold a banking analyst with McCarthy
  Crisanti and Maffei Inc
      It does reduce the banks exposure in energy loans and 54
  mln dlrs is a substantial amount Archibold said but the
  deal represents only about four pct of their energy loans
      Of First Citys total loan portfolio of 99 mln dlrs about
  14 pct or 14 billion dlrs were made to energy producers or
  suppliers analysts said Its record losses have been caused by
  its past status as one of the nations top lenders to oil and
  gas producers and suppliers during the boom days of the late
  1970s and early 1980s
      First City said about half of the loans sold to Prudential
  came from its Energy Finance Co an entity formed in 1982 to
  loan money to more venturesome oil borrowers that promised a
  higher potential return The other half of the loans were from
  First Citys lead bank in Houston
      Chris Kotowski an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co said
  the sale of the package of energy loans was the first
  encouraging news from First City in months
      Its not going to solve all of First Citys problems but
  its a good transaction for them It may be possible for them
  to sell additional loans Kotowski said Prudential can fund
  these things more cheaply than First City and theres an
  incentive to invest in troubled energy companies right now as
  values are depressed
      In a statement First City chairman JA Elkins said the
  banks strategy was to reduce the proportion of energy loans to
  total loans This move which we believe is the first
  transaction of its kind helps us further and we were able to
  make it without suffering a loss
