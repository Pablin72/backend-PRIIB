FINAL 5050 CORN CERTS SEEN AT 16 BILLION DLRS
  The Agriculture Department will have
  to release an estimated 16 billion dlrs worth of inkind
  certificates or certs to corn farmers this fall if USDA
  decides to maintain an equal split of total 1986 feedgrain
  deficiency payments in cash and certs USDA officials said
      Final 1986 crop deficiency payments will be available to
  feed grain producers in October Wheat deficiency payments for
  the 1986 crop now complete were made in a 5050
  cashcertificate split and USDA officials have indicated they
  want to do the same for feedgrains
      Over 32 billion dlrs of an estimated 60 billion in corn
  deficiency payments have already been announced with 142
  billion dlrs 43 pct set in certificates The final payment
  must be 16 billion dlrs in certs 57 pct for a 5050 split
      However the release this month of almost 600 mln dlrs of
  deficiency payments was equally divided in cash and certs
  doing nothing to bring up the percentage of certs
      Some USDA analysts said the payments reflected hesitation
  from the Office of Managament and Budget to allow another huge
  release of certs onto the market
      Bills are pending in Congress to move up the final
  feedgrain deficiency payment to as soon as five months after
  harvest as possible rather than the current year lag time
      Neither Rep Edward Madigan RIll nor Sen Bob Dole
  RKans sponsors of the bills have brought the legislation
  forward Aides said timing will depend on budget discussions
