  European Commission President Jacques
  Delors quoted by Le Monde newspaper said he favoured a
  FrancoGerman candidate to take over ltCie Generale de
  Constructions Telephoniques which has a 16 pct stake in the
  French public telephone switching market
      I wish for a European solution  That will enable Germany
  and France to move closer together which is currently
  necessary he was quoted as saying
      Given the situtation of the EC European Community and of
  the importance for our future connunications audiences and of
  cooperation already undertaken on the Community level that
  seems the best choice Delors added
      Five groups including an alliance between West Germanys
  Siemens AG ltSIEGF and Frances Schneider SA ltSCHNPA
  subsidiary JeumontSchneider have applied to buy what is
  Frances second largest telephone switching firm
      Under French privatisation law foreign companies are
  restricted to a 20 pct stake in privatised companies
