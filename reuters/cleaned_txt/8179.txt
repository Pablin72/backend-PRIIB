AUSTRALIAN WHEAT AREA TO FALL FORECASTER SAYS
  Australian wheat plantings are
  forecast to fall to 1040 mln hectares in 198788 from 1172
  mln sown in 198687 Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd AWF
  said in its first preliminary crop forecast
      But there was no reason to expect Australian production in
  198788 would be less than the 165 mln tonnes of last year
  the private forecaster said as crops in New South Wales and
  Queensland suffered from poor yields last season
      Most of the fall in plantings was expected in Western
  Australia while state average yields would be assisted by
  growers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks it said
      The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was a
  poor profit outlook under cost credit and yield pressures But
  in the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided
  that rainfall between now and June is not less than average
  AWF said
      Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut back
  wheat area by 20 pct AWF said this was unlikely since they
  needed cash flow and there were problems with alternative
  crops
      The lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds pulses and
  oats is a cause for concern if those crops are to comprise a
  high proportion of growers income AWF said
