BASF ltBASFF SAYS 1986 RESULTS AFFECTED BY DLR
  BASF AG said
  the volatile currency situation last year particularly the
  fall of the dollar led to sharp drops in turnover denominated
  in marks and to price reductions for exports from domestic
  production
      But in a statement accompanying yearend figures the group
  said it expected satisfactory business development over the
  next months At the moment we do not expect any extraordinary
  influences such as there were last year it said Orders in
  hand and incoming orders were steady at a high level
      BASF reported 136 pct lower 1986 world group pretax
  profit at 263 billion marks compared to 1985
      The unusual situation on the crude oil market last year
  also produced a clear sales slide in the oil and gas sector and
  forced price declines for petrochemical products BASF said
      The fall in pretax profit corresponded to the losses on
  stocks in the oil and gas sector at the beginning of 1986 In
  the parent company the positive earnings development
  continued it said where pretax profit rose by 32 pct to
  197 billion marks The decline in parent company turnover was
  balanced out by increased capacity use and price declines in
  raw materials 
      In 1986 world group turnover was off 88 pct at 4047
  billion marks compared to 1985 BASF said Parent turnover fell
  85 pct to 1872 billion
      Turnover increases with the exceptions of the sectors fine
  chemicals and informations systems had only been achieved in
  those areas widened last year through acquisition in 1985
      Results from these had been taken only partly into the
  fourth quarter of that year but fully included in 1986 data
      So far in the current year the investment volume of the
  parent company and the world group is exceeding that in 1986
  BASF said without giving concrete figures
