BRAZILS GROS TO MEET BANKS ON TRADE LINE ISSUE
  Brazils central bank governor
  Francisco Gros will meet senior commercial bankers here today
  in a new attempt to defuse the anger generated by the countrys
  unilateral suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs
  of foreign commercial bank debt bankers said
      Gros will meet representatives of Citibank the head of
  Brazils bank advisory committee and of coheads Morgan
  Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc
      High on the agenda will be banks complaints about Brazils
  accompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of shortterm trade
  and interbank lines the bankers said
      Brazils several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreed
  last March to extend the credit lines until March 31 1987 as
  part of a 31 billion dlr financing package
      Bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment coupled
  with Brazils freeze raised a spate of technical and legal
  questions that the banks want to discuss with Gros
      They said they face problems because of the freeze
  requirement that any payment due to be made by a Brazilian bank
  under the trade facility must be deposited instead with the
  central bank This means foreign bankers cannot easily switch
  their credit lines from one borrower to another
      The requirement to deposit with the central bank has also
  meant Brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lower
  interestrate spreads because foreign banks would rather
  accept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with the
  central bank
      Its caused a lot of illwill with the banking community
  one banker said
      Gros is also expected to brief the banks on the results of
  a 10day tour of Europe and Japan that he and finance minister
  Dilson Funaro have just completed to seek official support for
  Brazils debt stance
