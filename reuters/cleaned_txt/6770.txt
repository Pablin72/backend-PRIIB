US BANK INCOME SHOWS FIRST DROP IN 25 YEARS
  Problems in the farmbelt and
  oilpatch regions contributed to the first decline in overall
  income for US banks in a quarter century the Federal Deposit
  Insurance Corp FDIC said
      The nations 14181 commercial banks had net income of 178
  billion dlrs in 1986 down slightly from 1985s record 181
  billion dlrs
      The total was still the second highest ever reported but
  it was the first time income had not grown since 1961
      The figures reflected a radical split in the health of
  banks in the two halves of the country the FDIC said
      In the East one in 12 banks had losses last year while
  one in four banks west of the Mississippi River had losses
      Nationwide one out of five banks reported losses the FDIC
  said in the first of a new series of quarterly banking profiles
  it planned to issue
      I dont remember a time when there was such a clear
  distinction by geographic area FDIC Chairman William Seidman
  told reporters
      He said that while the figures were not good they showed
  the problem did not lie with the banking system as a whole but
  with regional differences in economic performance
      Some 44 banks have failed so far this year twice as many
  as failed by this time a year ago but Seidman said he doubted
  the pace would continue 
      On a positive note banks increased capital to a record 208
  billion dlrs last year and there has been a slowing in the
  number of new problem banks in all regions except the
  Southwest Seidman said
      Banks provision for losses from bad loans in the fourth
  quarter increased to 217 billion dlrs a 23 pct rise from a
  year ago
      Large banks  those with assets of one billion dlrs or
  more  reporting fourthquarter losses totaled 22 the FDIC
  said
      Seidman said it was too early to say what effect Brazils
  moratorium on debt interest payments would have on US banks
      He said bank deregulation had given managers more freedom
  to run their banks and that an increase in failures was to be
  expected
      But this freedom from regulatory restraints also has meant
  other banks that were better managed have gotten stronger
  Seidman said
