PDVSA INCOME ON OIL SALES FELL 45 PCT IN 1986
  The state oil company Petroeleos de
  Venezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income from
  oil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal by
  almost 100000 barrels a day Minister of Energy and Mines
  Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said
      Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annual
  assembly Hernandez said PDVSAs income from oil sales had
  dropped to 72 billion dlrs in 1986 down 45 pct from last
  years 133 billion
      Fiscal revenue from oil sales which was estimated at 66
  billion bolivares for 1986 totalled 435 billion a drop of 34
  pct which Hernandez said had a very serious impact on
  Venezuela
      PDVSAs export volume averaged 1508 mln barrels a day of
  which 658000 bpd were crude oil and 850000 bpd refined
  products
      The figure surpassed PDVSAs stated goal of 1410 mln bpd
  and the 1985 export volume of 1371 mln bpd But it was not
  enough to cover the losses from a drop in the average price
  from 2588 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 1390 dlrs last year
      The 1390 per barrel price for 1986 was 101 dlrs higher
  than the figure originally announced by the Central Bank
  Hernandez said the increase had come from a new accounting
  system which included the results of PDVSAs overseas refining
  and marketing operations
      Consumption in Venezuelas internal market increased from
  323000 bpd in 1985 to 342000 bpd last year However
  Hernandez stressed that the government had managed to keep
  gasoline sales almost constant at 164000 bpd
      Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrels
  in reserves of light and medium crudes shifting the balance of
  Venezuelas reserves away from heavy crude oil The countrys
  production capacity at yearend 1986 was 2562 mln bpd of
  which 1420 mln are light and medium crudes Hernandez said
       Venezuelas total proven reserves as of December 31 1986
  were 55521 billion barrels the fourth largest amount in the
  world Hernandez said
