CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH US
  China called on the United States to
  remove curbs on its exports to give it favourable trading
  status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology
      But the US Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing
  13 years of trade deficits with the US Out of the last 15 are
  inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade
  Congress to change laws which limit its exports
      The official International Business newspaper today
  published Chinas demands in a  editorial to coincide with the
  visit of US Secretary of State George Shultz
      It is extremely important that the US Market reduce its
  restrictions on Chinese imports provide the needed facilities
  for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese
  exports the editorial said
      The US Should quickly discard its prejudice against
  favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China
  into the Generalised System of Preference GSP
      Despite easing of curbs on US Technology exports in
  recent years control of them is still extremely strict and
  influences normal trade between the two countries it added
      The paper also printed an article by Chinas commercial
  counsellor in its Washington embassy Chen Shibiao who said
  that all kinds of difficulties and restrictions were preventing
  bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential
      He named them as US Protectionist behaviour curbs on
  technology transfer and outofdate trade legislation
