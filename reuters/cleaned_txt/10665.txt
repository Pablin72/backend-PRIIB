BALDRIGE PREDICTS END OF USJAPAN TRADE DISPUTE
  The United States and Japan will
  soon settle their trade dispute over semiconductors US
  Commerce secretary Malcolm Baldrige said on television
      Baldrige referring to the USJapan trade agreement on
  semiconductors said Their government wants to live up to it
  Their industries havent been doing it and I think well have
  a good settlement to spare both sides
      I think the Japanese understand full well that they havent
  lived up to this commitment he said
      He added I do not think there will be a trade war at all
      On Friday Washington announced plans to put as much as 300
  mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods from April 17
  because of Tokyos failure to observe the agreement
      The officials said the tariffs would be ended as soon as
  Japan started adhering to the agreement But they said there
  was little chance Japan could react quickly enough to avert the
  higher tariffs
      Baldrige said the Reagan administration hoped the strong
  US Action against Japan would convince Congress to tone down
  protectionist trade legislation now being drafted
      He denied the action had been taken for that reason
