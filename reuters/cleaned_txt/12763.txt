LONDON COCOA TRADES AT LOWS BY MIDMORNING
  Cocoa futures fell to session lows by
  midmorning posting losses from last night of six to two stg a
  tonne in 1987 deliveries dealers said
      Weekend profittaking by jobbers and general booksquaring
  featured the fall which was aided by steady sterling versus the
  dollar and lack of offtake in the physicals market
      Dealers said the market was switch and straddlebound in
  that any pressure on one particular month was certain to be
  reflected in adjacent deliveries
      The undertone however remained cautious as operators
  await an eventual start to ICCO buffer stock buying dealers
  said
      The market was originally forecast to open with average
  five stg gains from last night following New Yorks firmer
  close yesterday dealers said
      But this was largely counterbalanced by currency factors
      Near July traded at its session low of 1327 stg after one
  hour versus 1333 bid last night and an early high of 1335
      Volume midmorning was 730 lots including 350 lots crossed
  and 108 switches
      There was no sign of any origin activity
