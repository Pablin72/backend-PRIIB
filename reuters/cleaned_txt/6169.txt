US WARNS OF DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL
  A White Houseordered report said 
  that growing US reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000
  could have potentially damaging implications for national
  security
      The Energy Department study discusses several options to
  curb reliance on foreign oil but makes no recommendations
      President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled
  out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help
  the depressed domestic oil industry
      Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that
  although we have made gains in energy security in the last six
  years this report shows that there is justification for
  national concern both over declining competitiveness of our
  domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports
      The report said imports last year were 33 pct of US
  consumption and by the mid1990s could rise to 50 pct
      Among the reports options to ease US reliance on foreign
  oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration
      President Reagan ordered the study last September citing a
  determination that the country never again become captive to a
  foreign oil cartel referring to the OPECled oil shortages and
  sharp prices increases of the 1970s
      The report said an import fee would raise prices and help
  make it economical for US oil firms to find and produce new
  oil as well as to cut imports but on the whole the tax would
  depress the nations economy
      The study was outlined in a New York Times report today
