BP ltBP MAY HAVE TO RAISE BID   ANALYSTS
  British Petroleum Co PLC may have to
  raise its planned 70 dlrs a share tender offer for the publicly
  traded shares of Standard Oil Co ltSRD analysts said
      Theres a lot of speculation here that someway or other
  they would be forced to come up with another bid said Rosario
  Ilaqua of LF Rothschild
      And despite BP managing director David Simons denial today
  that BP would raise the offer the analysts said that remained
  a distinct possibility
      Analysts said they base their thinking on Royal DutchShell
  Groups ltRD ltSC bid to buy the outstanding stake of Shell Oil
  Co in 1984 and 1985 Royal DutchShell eventually raised its
  initial 55 dlrs a share offer to 60 dlrs a share after
  lawsuits by minority shareholders
      I think theyre going to have to go a little higher
  eventually just as Royal DutchShell had to go a little higher
  for the Shell Oil minority shares Bruce Lazier of Prescott
  Ball and Turben said He estimated a price of 75 dlrs a share
      Royal DutchShell offered 55 dlrs a share for the 305 pct
  of Shell Oil it did not already own in January of 1984 After
  objections from minority shareholders about the price Royal
  DutchShell raised its bid and began a 58 dlrs a share tender
  offer in April 1984
      But shareholders sued and a court blocked completion of the
  offer After months of wrangling over the worth of Shell Oil
  Royal DutchShell agreed to another two dlrs increase
      It ended up paying 567 billion dlrs for the outstanding
  Shell Oil stake a significant premium to its original bid of
  about 52 billion dlrs
      The analysts made their comments before Simons remarks at
  a BP press conference in New York this afternoon
      Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc told
  clients this morning that a sweetened offer was possible The
  analyst said the bid could be raised by two dlrs a share
      Analysts do not expect regulatory hurdles because of the
  Royal DutchShell group precedent But there may be shareholder
  lawsuits for the same reason they said
      Goldman Sachs and Co BPs investment advisor advised the
  Shell Oil board in 1984 and 1985
