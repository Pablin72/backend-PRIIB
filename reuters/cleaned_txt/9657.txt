US CHIPMAKERS URGE SANCTIONS AGAINST JAPAN
  The Semiconductor Industry
  Association urged the US government to impose trade sanctions
  against Japan for violating the USJapan Semiconductor Trade
  Agreement
      In a letter to Treasury Secretary James Baker the group
  said sanctions should be imposed against Japanese chipmakers as
  of April 1 and continue until the US is satisfied there is
  full compliance with the agreement
      The group said action by Japan to cut back on semiconductor
  exports is not what is required
      Americas interests require that agreements be honored and
  that US industries not bear the burden for the persistent
  unwillingness or inability of the government of Japan to
  deliver on its commitments the trade group said
      The White House Economic Policy Council is expected to
  discuss possible sanctions against Japan at a meeting scheduled
  for Thursday
      The trade group said Japan has not lived up to the terms of
  the agreement last year which was aimed at ending Japanese
  dumping of semiconductors and at opening Japanese markets to
  foreignbased manufacturers
