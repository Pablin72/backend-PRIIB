SENATE SEEKS US PROBE OF CANADIAN CORN LEVY
  The Senate voted unanimously to seek
  an expedited US probe of Canadian tariffs on corn imports to

      By 99 to 0 the Senate went on record against the 849
  cents per bushel tariff approved by the Canadian Import
  Tribunal
      The non binding measure asked for a probe by the US Trade
  Representative to determine within 30 days whether the tariff
  violates the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and if so
  recommend within 60 days to President Reagan retaliatory action
  against Canada
