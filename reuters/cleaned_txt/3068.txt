BANK OF FRANCE CUTS INTERVENTION RATE
  The Bank of France said it cut its money
  market intervention rate to 734 pct from eight pct when it
  injected money against first category paper
      The bank also cut its sevenday repossession rate to 812
  pct from 834 pct
      The intervention rate has stood at eight pct since it was
  raised from 714 pct on January 2 as the French franc came
  under pressure ahead of the EMS realignment on January 11
      The bank said the purchase effective tomorrow is for five
  pct of private paper and fixed rate Treasury bills maturing
  between March 25 and June 25 and of other Treasury bills
  maturing between March 25 1987 and March 25 1989
      The rate cut had been expected since the bank announced a
  money market intervention tender earlier today
      Money market dealers said conditions seemed right for a
  quarter percentage point cut reflecting an easing in the call
  money rate last week and the French francs steadiness on
  foreign exchange markets since the February 22 currency
  stabilisation accord here by the Group of Five and Canada
