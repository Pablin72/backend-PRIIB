ITALIAN PANEL URGES EXCHANGE LIBERALIZATION
  Liberalization of Italys foreign exchange
  controls should be gradual but also reasonably rapid a report
  issued by a study committee nominated by the Italian Treasury
  Ministry said
     The report looking at the countrys financial development
  prospects said Italys large public sector deficit and growing
  public debt were among the considerations that made a gradual
  liberalization preferable
      The report also favoured retention of the liras six pct
  oscillation band with the European Monetary System EMS during
  the liberalization process in order to lessen shortterm
  domestic interest rate fluctuations which could result from
  portfolio adjustments
      The liras fluctuation margin is currently significantly
  higher than that allowed for other EMS currencies
      Italy has over recent months announced a series of
  deregulation moves in response to a European Community
  directive aimed at creating a genuine common market in goods
  services and finance by 1992
