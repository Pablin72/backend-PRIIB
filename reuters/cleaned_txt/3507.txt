  billion dlrs for calendar 1987 against 1986 spending of 28
  billion dlrs the state oil company Pertamina said
      Actual spending last year fell short of the budgeted figure
  of 32 billion dlrs as oil companies slashed expenditure

  exploration wells and 431 development wells this year against
