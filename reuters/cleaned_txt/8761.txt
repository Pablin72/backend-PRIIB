VOLVO GROUP COMPANY PROPOSES TWOFORFIVE ISSUE
  ltAB Catena in which AB Volvo
  ltVOLVST has a 48 pct stake said it was proposing a
  twoforfive stock issue that will raise the companys equity
  capital to 420 mln crowns from 300 mln
      Catena reported profits after financial income and costs up
  to only 231 mln crowns from 207 mln in 1985 despite an
  increase in sales to 854 billion crowns from 559 billion in
  1985
      The company said that its 1986 performance was best
  reflected by earnings after writeoffs which rose to 310 mln
  from 221 mln in 1985
      Catenas increase in sales was mainly due to the takeover
  of Safveans AB in February 1986 which changed the business
  profile of Catena It had principally operated as a Volvo
  dealer With the Safveans acquisition it is now mainly a
  trading and industrial company
      In December 1986 Catena sold its share in the stockbroking
  firm Jacobson och Ponsbach Fondkommission AB This yielded a
  profit of 3867 mln crowns and was reflected in Catenas
  pretax earnings which rose to 724 mln crowns from 204 mln in
  1985
