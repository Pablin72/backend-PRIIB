LAWSON EXPECTS INTEREST RATE FALL SOON
  UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
  Lawson said he expected British interest rates to fall soon in
  response to his fiscal 198788 budget but he did not say by
  how much
      I would be very surprised if there is not a very early
  further fall in interest rates Lawson said in a radio
  interview
      Analysts said they foresaw UK Base rates falling as early
  as today by as much as one full percentage point after Lawsons
  announcement yesterday that the public sector borrowing
  requirement in fiscal 198788 and 198889 was to fall to 10
  pct of GDP or some four billion stg
      British banks base lending rates fell a half percentage
  point on March 9 to the current 105 pct
