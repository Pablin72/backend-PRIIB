NZ CENTRAL BANK SEES SLOWER MONEY CREDIT GROWTH
  Monetary and credit growth rates in
  New Zealand are not expected to continue at current levels
  following the Reserve Banks move to tighten liquidity late
  last year Reserve Bank Governor Spencer Russell said
      The monetary and credit growth figures for the December
  quarter were probably artifically inflated by unusually high
  growth in interinstitutional lending activity on the short
  term money market Russell said in a statement
      The bank moved to tighten liquidity when the initial signs
  of the recent expansion became apparent in September and
  October last year Russell said
      Broadly defined M3 figures released today showed growth of
  178 pct in the year ended December compared with 131 pct in
  the year ended September
      Annual growth of private sector credit in calendar 1986 was
  307 pct compared with 165 pct in the September year
      Available evidence suggests that corporate customers
  including nonbank financial institutions have been exploiting
  differences between interest rates on overdrafts with trading
  banks and rates in the call market Russell said
