WEATHER HURTING YUGOSLAV WHEAT  USDA REPORT
  Unfavorable late winter weather
  conditions in the main wheat growing areas of Yugoslavia
  indicate dimmed prospects for the emerging winter wheat crop
  the US embassys agricultural officer in Belgrade said
      The officer who travelled through an area from Belgrade to
  Subotica said in a field report dated March 27 the wheat crop
  had been set back at least three weeks because of a cold spell
  that followed a period of warm weather
      He said unseasonably warm weather in late February that
  brought the wheat crop out of winter dormancy early was
  followed by three weeks of unusually cold weather
      Damaging effects were seen in the fields most of which
  show stands with a yellowbrown cast indicating extensive leaf
  and possible root damage from repeated freezings he said
      The report said that since much of the early growth in
  February was from late seeding rather than from normal
  development his view was that the damage may be more extensive
  than some local observers say
      The most seriously affected fields were lateseeded fields
  on normal maize soils Stands in these fields were thin and
  chances of recovery appeared less favorable he said
      However he said soil moisture conditions were favorable
  and many of the fields had already been topdressed which
  would aid recovery
