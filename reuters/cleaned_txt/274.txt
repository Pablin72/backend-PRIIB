INDONESIAN PALM OIL OUTPUT EXPECTED TO RISE
  Indonesias palm oil output is expected
  to rise and exports to increase the US Embassy said in its
  annual report on Indonesias agriculture sector
      The Indonesian government said crude palm oil CPO output
  is expected to rise to 156 mln tonnes in 1987 and 211 mln in
  1988 up from a projected 145 mln tonnes in 1986 and 126 mln
  in 1985
      The 1986 projection of 145 mln tonnes is up from a
  provisional figure of 13 mln tonnes
      A US Embassy assessment puts 1987 output at 145 mln
  tonnes against 135 mln in 1986 and 1208 mln in 1985
      More realistic estimates indicate that 1988 production will
  be between 15 and 16 mln tonnes the report said
      The report said the abolition of the five pct CPO export
  tax the devaluation of the rupiah in September 1986 and higher
  international palm oil prices should lead to a modest increase
  in exports this year
      Exports are forecast to rise to 720000 tonnes against
  695000 tonnes in 1986 the report added
