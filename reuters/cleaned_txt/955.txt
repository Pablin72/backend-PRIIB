      The government which published the January unemployment
  figures today did not make any predictions

  rate this year but it is difficult to foresee the situation
  improving a Labour Ministry official said
      Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had
  expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300000
  people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April
      Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference
  the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget
  which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms
      The yens surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel
  and shipbuilding industries Other exportdependent industries
  such as cars and textiles have laid off parttime employees
  and ceased hiring economists said
      Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a
  great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down
  said Koichi Tsukihara Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank

  sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the
