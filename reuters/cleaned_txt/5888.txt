TALKING POINTCOPPER STOCKS
  Copper shares which have lagged
  behind the market should pick up steam this year on stronger
  demand and improving prices for the metal analysts said
      Copper prices should move up over the next four to six
  quarters said Daniel Roling of Merrill Lynch and Co ltMER I
  see average copper prices at 70 cts a pound in 1988 up from
  around 63 or 64 cts based on tight supply and continued world
  economic growth
      Other analysts see metal prices ranging from 65 to 68 cts a
  pound this year and 70 to 73 cts in 1988
      Analysts said Phelps Dodge Corp ltPD will be a strong
  performer because it is the largest US copper producer
      But Asarco Inc ltAR with about 45 pct of total sales from
  copper and Newmont Mining Corp ltNEM are also potential
  winners they said Newmont is spinning off 85 pct of its
  copper operations to its shareholders
      In theory Phelps is the best stock Its the purest play
  and benefits most from higher copper prices one said
      William Siedenburg of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co
  said Phelps has lowered costs and streamlined mining
  operations Theyve accomplished a great deal he said
      The companys move into carbon black a product used in
  tires should provide steady earnings although not rapid
  growth as a hedge against a copper downturn Siedenburg said
  He estimates Phelps will earn 245 dlrs in 1987 and 445 dlrs
  in 1988 including tax benefits versus 179 dlrs in 1986
      Other analysts including Clarence Morrison of Dean Witter
  Reynolds Inc and Merrills Roling also recommend Phelps
      Morrison projects Phelps will earn 325 dlrs in 1987 and
  four dlrs in 1988 while Roling sees earnings at 275 dlrs this
  year and around 350 dlrs next year
      The stock can go to the mid 30s Roling said from its
  current level of around 30 But others see it climbing to 40
      Their Phelps Dodge costs are so low they dont need
  copper prices higher than 70 cts to make a lot of money said
  Vahid Fathi of Prescott Ball and Turben Inc The shares will
  outperform the market over the next 18 months he said
      But Nick Toufexis of PrudentialBache Securities Inc says
  Newmont Mining is a more attractive investment Wed rather
  place our bets with Newmont Any way you slice it I see a
  significant premium to the current stock price he said
      After the spinoff which closes next month Newmont will
  have gold operations including 95 pct of Newmont Gold Co
  ltNGC a 15 pct stake in its copper unit and energy operations
  Toufexis noted
      Analysts see Newmont earning 285 dlrs to three dlrs in
  1987 and about 375 dlrs in 1988 versus earnings of about 140
  dlrs from operations in 1986
      Id be buying up to 90 Toufexis said last week when the
  stock rose sharply to near that level But the shares are
  probably worth about 108 dlrs each
      Dean Witters Morrison and Fathi of Prescott Ball like
  Asarco because of cost cutting and restructuring Morrison
  sees 1987 earnings at 125 dlrs and 1988 at 175 against losses
  in 1986 Fathi projects Asarco will earn one dlr in 1987 and
  from three dlrs to 325 dlrs in 1988
      Roling of Merrill Lynch is recommending Cyprus Minerals Co
  ltCYPM in addition to Phelps Dodge Cyprus has interests in
  coal and other minerals aside from copper
      But Siedenburg of Smith Barney thinks Cyprus is overpriced
  at current levels I would be willing to sell Cyprus and buy
  Phelps Dodge if I were picking one copper stock he said
