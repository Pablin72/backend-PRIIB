SOUTHERN ltSO TO TAKE CHARGE ON VOGTLE COST
  Southern Co said it will take an
  aftertax charge of 226 mln dlrs against earnings no later than
  January 1988 because the projected cost of the Vogtle nuclear
  power plant has risen abover the amount which retail customers
  in Georgia will be asked to pay
      The companys largest subsidiary Georgia Power Co said
  the budget for the plant has increased by 63 pct or 522 mln
  dlrs to 887 billion However because of a pledge the made
  last year to Georgias Public Service Commission the increased
  cost will not be included in the utilitys retail electric
  rates
      Geogia Power also said its board has delayed the scheduled
  completion of Vogtles Unit Two to June 1989 from September
  1988 Unit Two is about 60 pct complete it added
      The utility said fuel loading has been completed at Unit
  One and the unit is being put through a series of lowpower
  tests before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is asked for a
  fullpower license
      The nuclear power plant located near Waynesboro Ga is
  coowned by ltOglethorpe Power Corp the Municipal Electric
  Authority of Georgia and the city of Dalton
      Georgia Power said the revised Vogtle budget estimate was
  due to several factors including additional labor costs
  incurred to keep the plants first unit on schedule for
  commercial operation by June The new figure represents the
  first change in the plants budget since August 1985 when it
  was estimated at 835 billion dlrs
      In March 1986 the utility told Georgia regulators it would
  cap the price of Vogtle its customers would be asked to pay
  at 356 billion dlrs the companys share of the then projected
  835 billion dlr total Under the new budget Georgia Power
  said its share amounts to 387 billion dlrs
      Noting that Georgia Powers share of the Vogtle increase is
  313 mln dlrs Southern said this will result in a charge
  against earnings of 177 mln dlrs after taxes
      In addition the company said Georgia Powers contracts
  with the joint owners require the utility to buy back
  significant amounts of Vogtle capacity during the plants
  initial years of operation Under terms of the cap on costs it
  will not attempt to recover the portion of the budget increase
  that applies to the buybacks
      This bings the total amount that must be charged against
  earnings to 2326 mln dlrs after taxes Southern said
      Southern said new rules of the Financial Accounting
  Standards Board which are effective in January 1988 require
  any costs that are determined nonrecoverable to be charged
  against earnings once that determination is made
      The company also said its board has approved a capital
  budget of 21 billion dlrs in 1987 including work on the
  Vogtle project
      It said a 59 billion dlr capita budget for the threeyear
  period 19871989 was also outlined at the board meeting noting
  this is 700 mln dlrs below the comparable figure for the years
  19861988
