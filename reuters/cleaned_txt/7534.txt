CHINESE PORT UNDERUSED DESPITE CONGESTION NEARBY
  The Chinese port of Ningbo is
  working well below capacity despite being only 130 miles from
  Shanghai which is seriously congested a port official said
      Jiang Feng Xiang said the port  the deepest in China 
  handled 1795 mln tonnes of cargo last year up from 1044 mln
  in 1985 but well below its potential capacity of 32 mln
  tonnes Shanghai handled 100 mln tonnes of cargo in 1986
      Jiang said Ningbo is underutilised because of its
  inadequate facilities including a single track rail line
  linking it to Hangzhou where it joins the national network
      Ningbo handles crude oil exports and transhipments of coal
  from north to south China and imports include fertiliser and
  soda ash and iron ore from Brazil and Australia The docks can
  handle ships of up to 150000 tonnes and oil tankers of up to
  200000 tonnes can load and unload in the harbour
      Most of Ningbos port infrastructure has been built since
  1979 official publications show A container berth and two
  timber and three general cargo berths will be added during the
  current 198690 fiveyear plan Jiang said
      The rail line to Hangzhou will be double tracked by 1995
  By 2000 maybe we will overtake Shanghai he added
