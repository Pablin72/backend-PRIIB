LOWER REFINERY OPERATIONS SEEN PRODUCING PROFITS
  US refiners will have to
  reduce operations if they want to be profitable this year said
  industry officials attending the National Petroleum Refiners
  Association meeting here
       If the refining sector can discipline itself to refine
  about 12 mln barrels of crude oil a day we have a chance to
  pull down inventories to acceptable levels by the second
  quarter said Archie Dunham executive vice president of
  petroluem products at Conoco Inc
      If not the industry will have a tough 1987 he added
       Last weeks American Petroleum Institute report said that
  US refining capacity rose three pct to 787 pct of capacity
  with crude oil runs at 122 mln barrels per day for the week
  ended March 20
       The API said that with the higher crude oil runs 
  distillate and gasoline inventories were sharply above yearago
  levels Gasoline stocks were at 2456 mln barrels some 172
  mln barrels above yearago levels Distillate stocks at 1087
  mln barrels are 109 mln barrels above last years level the
  API said
       Henry Rosenberg chairman of Crown Central Petroleum Corp
  ltCNP told Reuters that unless refining and marketing return to
  profitability oil companies will have to rely on downstream
  operations to produce an acceptable level of earnings
       The jump in refining capacity is a concern if it
  continues said Kenneth Buckler executive vice president of
  refining and marketing at ltTotal Petroleum Co a US
  subsidiary of Cie Francaise Des Petroles of France
       Refineries should operate near 75 pct of capacity given
  the current level of demand but the operating level should
  increase as gasoline demand picks up in the next quarter
  Buckler said
       Dunham said the potential operable capacity of US
  refineries should also be cut about 500000 barrels of crude
  per day I expect to see the shutdown of more small refineries
  over the next five years he said adding that these
  facilities refine between 10000 and 30000 barrels of crude
  oil per day The API said US operations have the capacity to
  refine 156 mln bpd of crude
