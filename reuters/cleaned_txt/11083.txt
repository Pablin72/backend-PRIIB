FEDS POLICY EASE MAY END WITH 2ND QTR RATE CUT
  The Federal Reserves move to easier
  monetary policy begun with four quick halfpoint discount rate
  cuts in 1986 will likely end with a final rate drop in the
  second quarter analysts said
      A poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates to
  edge lower with the Fed likely to drop its basic lending rate
  from 512 pct late next quarter to help the economy
      The Fed is not likely to ease policy much further without
  a fullblown recession said Raymond Stone chief financial
  economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
      Stone said economic data available by late June may be just
  weak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut But he said
  it may only be a quarterpoint drop instead of the usual half
  point to avoid hurting the dollar further
      All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open Market
  Committee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged
      The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly
  quarterpoint drops by the end of June in both the Treasury
  bond yield to 712 pct and the Federal funds rate at which
  banks lend to one another to 578 pct Most expect the prime
  lending rate at major banks to remain at 712 pct
      Other broad predictions of the survey relating mainly to
  the AprilJune quarter follow
       The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further
  against other major currencies because of a large US budget
  deficit and a wide but narrowing trade gap Contacted after
  the dollars steep drop in the last two business days the
  economists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that
  the dollar will fall more rather than less than they expect
       Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue
  trading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well
  test the lower end of that range
       Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and
  probably for all of 1987 Stocks should gain on strong
  foreign demand and a modest secondhalf economic rise The
  outlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year
  since both inflation and interest rates may be edging up
       Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflator
  will rise to around 33 pct this year from 27 pct in 1986 The
  sharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation as will
  a mild economic pickup in the second half of this year
       US real gross national product which grew at a two pct
  annual rate in the 1986 second half should expand at
  respective rates of about 23 pct and 25 pct in the 1987 first
  and second halves Firstquarter growth is put at a 24 pct
  annual
  rate slowing to 21 pct next quarter
      Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International sees
  both the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among
  those surveyed He expects real GNP which grew at a 11 pct
  rate in fourthquarter 1986 to expand at a 33 pct rate this
  quarter and 35 pct next quarter
      The economy will bounce back more strongly than many
  expect Brusca said He said an involuntary buildup in
  inventories largely in autos will add to firstquarter
  economic growth with consumer spending helping later
      Were running out of special factors to keep the economy
  afloat said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp His
  interest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest
      Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation
  helped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth respectively
  He expects 25 pct first quarter growth but said that second
  quarter growth could be zero or negative
      Braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer
  from a paring of inventories lower capital investment slow 
  government spending and less construction Only a marginally
  narrower trade deficit will add to growth
      He sees a 710 pct endofJune yield on Treasury bonds
  with Federal funds and prime rates at 550 and seven pct
  respectively Nikkos Brusca projects rates of 825 pct for
  bonds 615 pct for funds and 775 pct for the prime rate
      Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildly
  after the dollars fall to 40year lows versus the yen in past
  days and news of pending US trade sanctions against Japan
      David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Inc
  raised his endJune bond yield forecast to 750 pct from 720
  pct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 580 pct
      Raul Nicho president of Money Market Services Inc lifted
  his forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a point
  to eight pct for bonds and 614 pct for funds Both Nicho and
  Resler left their endJune prime rate forecast at 712 pct
      The higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that Japanese
  investors will be less eager to buy US bonds because of fear
  about further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to US
  trade sanctions Yields may have to rise to lure other buyers
