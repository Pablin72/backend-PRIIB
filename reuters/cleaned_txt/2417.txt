  world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply
  imbalance

  an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and
  production
      It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and
  harmony into the world agricultural tradeif not the
  disruptions in markets may grow even more severe the walls of
  protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation
  become more harmful US Department of Agriculture Deputy
  Administrator William Bailey said
      Bailey said his attendance at the twoday meeting which
  ends tomorrow demonstrated the US recognises the need to
  adjust its policies to the changing market environment
      The need for urgent reforms is justified by the imbalance
  and tensions of the world economy the secretary general of the
  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
  JeanClaude Paye said
      And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement on
  Tariffs and Trade he noted
      Paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint
  reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures
  to help farmers in unprofitable areas
      Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm
  prices allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand and
  instead help farmers through income support and adjustment

  Cargill USA one of the worlds largest cereal houses
      FranzJosef Feiter agricultural adviser to West German
  Chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed the European Community must take
  greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices
      However differentiated policy treatment is required to
  take account of large disparities in the situation around the
  EC he said
      Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economy
  and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the
  Community he said
