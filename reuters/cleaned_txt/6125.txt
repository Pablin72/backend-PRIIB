US OIL TAX WOULD NOT AFFECT PDVSACHAMPLIN DEAL
  an eventual oil import fee in the
  united states will make no difference to champlin petroleum
  corps joint venture agreement signed today with petroleos de
  venezuela pdvsa champlin chairman william adams said
      this was an aspect which was discussed at length during the
  negotiations but we can say our contract covers all
  eventualities in this regard he told reuters during the
  signing ceremony here
      Venezuelas energy and mines minister arturo hernandez
  grisanti earlier described the agreement under which pdvsa
  buys 50 pct of champlins corpus christi refinery as one more
  step in the maturation and presence of our oil industry in
  world markets
     union pacific chairman william cook said the agreement will
  be beneficial to both sides combining a secure source of
  supply with a modern refinery and access to markets
      we are looking to a longterm relationship and at a time
  of protectionist tendencies in the US Congress there are
  clear benefits to both sides he said
      Adams said pdvsa crude would remain competitive even with
  an oil import fee because champlin had invested heavily over
  the years in adapingthe texas refinery to process venezuelan
  heavy crudes with coking and hydrotreating facilities and
  obtain a competitive product yield
      therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been a
  consideration in the negotiations and it remains to be seen
  what such a fee would represent we do not foresee any impact
  on todays agreement adams said
      He said the refinery could run crude as heavy as
  venezuelas bolivar coastal field bcf 17 api without any
  difficultiesand would probably move over time to a heavier diet
  to take advantage of bigger margins
      The refinery has a capacity to process up to 110000 bpd of
  venezuelan high sulphur content heavy crude with an 8085 pct
  yield of white products
