  A meeting of leading politicians
  bankers and economists has forecast Austrian real gross
  domestic product growth for this year at between 05 and 15
  pct a government spokesman said
      This compared with a two pct growth forecast made by the
  semiofficial Institute for Economic Research WIFO last
  December

  told Reuters that the forecast had been made during the meeting
  attended by Vranitzky Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina
  National Bank President Stefan Koren and a WIFO representative
      Economists have been cutting growth forecasts recently
  mainly due to expectations of a poor export performance this
  year notably to Eastern Europe and oil exporting states
      Hannes Androsch general director of
  CreditanstaltBankverein ltCABVVI today put 1987 GDP growth
  at between one and 15 pct
      Kramer also said the meeting had heard that unemployment
  for the year would be above the 55 pct forecast but was
  unlikely to be more than six pct
