      The increase followed a revised 02 pct rise in personal
  income during January Earlier the department estimated
  January personal income was unchanged
      The February incomes rise was the largest monthly increase
  since a 12 pct rise in April 1986 the department said It
  attributed last months rise to several factors including
  subsidy payments to farmers and government pay raises

  billion dlrs after falling by 584 billion dlrs or two pct in

  widespread through durable and nondurable industries the
  department said
      Farmers incomes increased by 122 billion dlrs in February
  after declining by 87 billion dlrs in January Both last
  months increase and Januarys fall in farm incomes was because
  of government subsidy payments the department said
      Personal tax and nontax payments fell 55 billion dlrs in
  February following a 195 billion dlrs January drop The 
  declines were a result of the Tax Reform Act of 1986
      Federal withheld income taxes were up in February from a
  month earlier but that was offset by declines in federal
  nonwithheld taxes and lower state and local income taxes
      Disposable personal income in February after taxes was up
  12 pct or 378 billion dlrs to 30634 billion dlrs after
  rising 258 billion dlrs in January
