US SEES NO NEW COFFEE AGREEMENT TALKS SOON
  The United States does not expect
  the executive board meeting of the International Coffee
  Organization ICO to call for a new round of negotiations on
  reinstating coffee quotas a US government official said
      The official a member of the US delegation to ICO talks
  earlier this year said no new coffee agreement talks are
  expected because there is no indication the negotiating
  positions of major producers and consumers have changed
      The US still demands as a condition of reimposition of
  coffee quotas that objective criteria be set for
  establishing quotas said the US official who asked not to
  be identified Brazil the major producer insists on quotas
  based on a traditional formula
      The US remains open to a negotiating meeting but only if
  some new flexibility is apparent from major countries the
  official said
      The ICO executive board meets tomorrow in London
