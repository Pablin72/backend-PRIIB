INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS
  India is searching for noncommunist
  countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and
  conserve foreign exchange
      Wheat tobacco tea coffee jute engineering and
  electronic goods as well as minerals including iron ore are
  all on offer in return for crude oil petroleum products
  chemicals steel and machinery trade sources told Reuters
      Most of the impetus behind countertrade which began in
  1984 comes from two state trading firms  the State Trading
  Corp STC and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp MMTC
      The two state trading corporations are free to use their
  buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian
  exports a commerce ministry spokeswoman said adding that
  private firms are excluded from countertrading
      One trade source said India has targetted countries that
  depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign
  imports But countertrade deals still make up only a small part
  of Indias total trading and are likely to account for less
  than eight pct of the estimated 1853 billion dlrs in trade
  during the nine months ended December the sources said
      Countertrade accounted for just five pct of Indias 2565
  billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 198586 ended March
  against almost nothing in 198485 official figures show
      However the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern
  Bloc paid in nonconvertible Indian rupees the sources said
      Total trade with the Soviet Union involving swaps of
  agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude
  oil is estimated at 304 billion dlrs in fiscal 198687
