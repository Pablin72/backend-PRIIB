US WILLING TO TALK TO MOSCOW ON WHEAT PRICE
  US Agriculture undersecretary Dan
  Amstutz indicated the United States is willing talk with the
  Soviet Union about the competitiveness of US wheat prices but
  would not discuss making US wheat prices cheap
      There sometimes is a difference between being competitive
  and being cheap Amstutz told a Senate Agriculture
  Appropriations hearing
      Amstutz said the difference of opinion between Moscow and
  Washington last summer on the level of the US subsidy offered
  on wheat to the Soviet Union was over whether the US wheat
  price was competitive or cheap
      I think there is a US willingness to explore this
  issue as it pertains to competitiveness Amstutz said
      However Amstutz added that the United States would not be
  willing to discuss wheat prices with Moscow if the issue is
  being cheap
      Asked later by a reporter what he meant by the distinction
  between competitive and cheap Amstutz would not elaborate
      Amstutz said it is the US judgment that the longterm
  grain agreement between the two countries calls for Moscow to
  buy at least four mln tonnes each of wheat and corn annually at
  prices in effect in this country
      Amstutz made the comments in response to a question from
  Sen Charles Grassley RIowa about expanding the export
  enhancement program to include grain sales to the Soviet Union
