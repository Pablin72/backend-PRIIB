  BorgWarner Corp said it has had
  discussions with Irwin Jacobs on his interest in the
  possibility of Minstar Inc ltMNST a Jacobs controlled company
  being given access to certain nonpublic information about
  BorgWarner
      In late February an investor group headed by Jacobs
  offered 44 dlrs a share or 329 billion dlrs to take over
  BorgWarner
      BorgWarner said it advised Jacobs that before its board
  would give Minstar access to company records Minstar would have
  to provide satisfactory evidence that sufficient financing was
  committed to carry out whatever transaction was proposed
      A BorgWarner spokesperson said the discussions with Jacobs
  and other Minstar officials focused on terms and conditions
  under which the company would consider granting Minstar access
  to the information it was seeking
      The BorgWarner spokesperson said the company has not been
  able to reach an agreement with Minstar and BorgWarner has
  not granted Minstar access to any records
      There can be no assurance that there will be further
  discussions with Jacobs or that any agreement will be reached
