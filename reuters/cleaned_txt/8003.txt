LDC FOOD AID NEEDS DECLINE IN 198687  USDA
  Total food aid needs in 69 of the
  least developed countries declined in 198687 as requirments
  fell in many countries in Africa the Middle East and Asia the
  US Agriculture Department said
      In a summary of its World Agriculture Report the
  department said grain production in subSaharan Africa was a
  record high in 1986 with gains in almost every country
      However food needs in Central America rose worsened by
  droughtreduced crops and civil strife
      Record wheat production in 198687 is pushing global wheat
  consumption for food to a new high and higher yielding
  varieties have been particularly effective where spring wheat
  is a common crop it said
      However may developing countries in tropical climates
  such as SubSaharan Africa Southeast Asia and Central
  America are not well adapted for wheat production and
  improved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs the
  department said
      World per capita consumption of vegetable oil will rise in
  198687 for the third straight year
      Soybean oil constitutes almost 30 pct of vegetable oil
  consumption while palm oil is the most traded the department
