ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT  US DEFICIT WITH NICs
  The US trade deficit with Taiwan and
  Korea is expected to widen this year despite some economic and
  currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries
  economists said
      The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the US in
  1986 will get bigger This time next year the US will be
  screaming at those countries about their exports said Steve
  Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co
      Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the US
  after Japan and Canada while Korea is the seventh largest
      Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress
  the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric
  against Taiwan and Korea urging those countries to allow their
  currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade
      The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized
  countries NICs amid signs the dollars steep drop against the
  currencies of Japan and most EC nations  previously the main
  focus of the US drive to cut its trade gap  is beginning to
  close the competiveness gap for American goods
      US Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he
  expects a reduction in Japans trade surplus this year
      But US manufacturers still are losing markets on their
  own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea whose currencies have not
  risen as much as the yen and the mark As major beneficiaries
  of soft oil prices and with low labor costs Taiwanese and
  Korean exporters are wellplaced to take up the slack
      In 1986 the fashionable comment in Washington was
  Japanbashing Now its NICbashing said Robert Chandross of
  Lloyds Bank PLC
      Asias four main NICs  Hong Kong South Korea Singapore
  and Taiwan  accounted for almost onefifth of the overall 170
  billion dlr US merchandise trade deficit for 1986
      The US trade gap with Taiwan rose to 157 billion dlrs in
  1986 from 131 billion in 1985 while the bilateral trade
  deficit with South Korea grew to 71 billion from 48 billion
      And preliminary US data show that the growth trend is
  continuing The US trade shortfall with Taiwan was 16
  billion dlrs in January up 244 pct from a year earlier The
  gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs up 248 pct from a year ago
      Lately both nations have said they will take steps to
  defuse incipient trade tensions Korea said it is choosing many
  of the 122 items on which the US wants it to cut import
  tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation
      Still South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last
  week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to
  five years as a way to cut its 445 billion dlr foreign debt
      For its part Taiwan said in January that it will cut
  tariffs on 1700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and
  try to diversify exports But vice economic minister Wang
  ChienShien said last month that he still does not expect
  Taiwans trade surplus with the US will fall in 1987
      The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles
  and electronic goods But Korea is raising its profile in the
  area of bigticket manufactured goods notably cars
      Korea expects its auto exports  mostly for North America
   to balloon to 675000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985
      The NICs exports are almost all manufactured goods When
  their exports rise it hits the heart of the US manufacturing
  base It cuts directly to us and to our customers said Bob
  Wendt manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp
      The US takes 90 pct of Koreas computer products exports
  72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its
  telecommunications equipment
      A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and
  South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the US
      While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the
  US these are offset by their deficits with other countries
      But Taiwan and to a lesser extent South Korea stand in
  marked contrast Both of these nations have moved rapidly into
  large bilateral surplus with the US and major overrall trade
  and current account surpluses the Morgan study says
      Morgan expects Taiwans overall trade surplus to grow to
  185 billion dlrs in 1987 from 152 billion last year and
  Koreas to increase to 65 billion dlrs from 35 billion
      Concern about the NICs is not confined to the US
      A lot of Korea and Taiwans exports to the US have been
  at Japans expense said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp
      Februarys Paris meeting of six major industrial powers
  exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies
      But this twopronged approach has drawn little response
  from the two nations so far and in any case will only work
  with a sizeable lag economists say
      The US has not said how much it thinks the Taiwans and
  Koreas currencies should climb The Taiwan dollar which is
  pegged to the US dollar has risen about 15 pct since
  September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct
      But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against
  the US unit and the won has lost seven pct economists say
      Weve not seen any lessening of competition from those
  countries that we can attribute to currency changes said
  Bethlehem Steels Wendt
      And so far US pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their
  hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect
      Moreover it is uncertain how far US protectionism will
  get given the administrations freetrade stance Its hard to
  see that anything will be passed much before yearend And then
  the question is will it have teeth one economist said
