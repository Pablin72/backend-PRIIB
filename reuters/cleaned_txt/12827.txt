TALKING POINTSANTA FE SOUTHERN ltSFX
  Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp may have
  more difficulty combining its two railroads than fending off a
  possible takeover by Henley Group ltHENG which has accumulated
  almost a five pct stake in the real estate and railroad
  conglomerate analysts said
      Takeover speculation has surrounded Santa Fe since Henley
  disclosed its stake in the company earlier this week but
  analysts and a Santa Fe official were skeptical a takeover is
  its intention
      Analysts also said the company has strong defenses that
  would easily deter any suitor  one of those being its problems
  combining its two railroad properties which hang in regulatory
  limbo
      Richard Fischer of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc said that Santa
  Fe at December 31 had 580 mln dlrs in cash and cash
  equivalents while its longterm debt to capital was just over
  25 pct This gives them plenty of borrowing power he said
  which could be used against an unwanted suitor
      Henley Groups Chairman Michael Dingman has said he wants
  to take major positions in undervalued natural resource
  companies He also told Reuters in an interview he is seeking
  an acquisition of from two billion to eight billion dlrs
      Santa Fe officials dont appear concerned that Henley might
  launch a takeover I would not characterize the atmosphere
  around here as one of concern one Santa Fe executive said
  about Henley
      I think its wrong to assume Dingman has formed a firm
  strategy with Santa Fe said Mark Hassenberg who covers
  Henley for DLJ Securities
      Analysts say the potential of Santa Fes land assets are
  likely to be realized slowly They add that Santa Fes efforts
  to merge its two railroads remain in regulatory limbo
  sidetracking many of its strategic plans for the foreseeable
  future
      These realities they said support the Henley Groups
  statement that its Santa Fe stake is only an investment
      The more pressing problem facing Santa Fe is overcoming
  difficulties in merging its two railroads the Atchison Topeka
  and Santa Fe Railway Co and Southern Pacific Transportation Co
  The merger would create the nations secondlongest railroad
      Last July the Interstate Commerce Commission ICC denied
  the merger on anticompetitive grounds
      The company since has granted trackagesharing rights to
  four western railroads to meet the ICCs concerns and persuade
  it to reopen the hearings in its threeyearold struggle to
  merge the lines
      My guess is the commission will decide in three to six
  weeks whether to reopen hearings Fischer said
      I believe theyve made an effort to satisfy the ICCs
  objections he said But in doing so they havent pleased
  everyone Before they had Burlington Northern on their side
  now Burlington is opposed to the way trackage rights are set
  up
      If the hearings are reopened analysts predicted it will
  take six to nine months for everyone to have their say and up
  to another year for the ICC to decide
      Santa Fe is in the midst of a 50mlnshare stock buyback
  program begun in 1984 It has bought back 337 mln shares as of
  February 1 when it had 1547 mln shares outstanding a
  spokesman said
      Among the shares repurchased were two stakes owned by
  Norfolk Southern one of 34 mln shares bought in 1986 and
  another of 17 mln shares in 1985 one analyst said
      James Voytko at Paine Webber believes Santa Fe could fight
  off the Henley Group with its cash and credit Citing the share
  buybacks from Norfolk Southern he said one of Santa Fes
  options if threatened could be to buy the Henley stake
      It is indeed possible that Dingman sees this as a
  lowrisk opportunistic investment Voytko said
      People who follow Santa Fe have given me values of 45 dlrs
  to 50 dlrs a share said DLJ Securities Hassenberg But Im
  certain that in Dingmans mind the company is worth more than
  that in breakup value
