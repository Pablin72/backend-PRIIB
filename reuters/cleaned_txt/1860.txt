ALLISCHALMERS ltAH PROPOSES RESTRUCTURING
  AllisChalmers Corp said it asked
  lenders and other groups to approve a restructuring plan that
  would cause a dilution of the companys existing common stock
      The company said it would sell all of its businesses other
  than the American Air Filter business make a public financing
  of more than 100 mln dlrs and pay part of the currently
  outstanding debt with the proceeds
      Under the plan which was presented to institutional
  lenders the companys unions and the Pension Benefit Guaranty
  Corp substantial amounts of institutional debt would be
  converted to common stock of the restructured company
      AllisChalmers said it will exchange existing preferred
  stock for common The exchange of the institutional debt and
  preferred stock for common equity will cause a resulting
  dilution of the existing common stock AllisChalmers said in
  a statement
      Under the plan holders of existing common would hold about
  15 pct of the restructured common stock Holders of existing
  preferred would hold about 35 pct of the new common
      AllisChalmers said its only alternative to the plan is
  bankruptcy The restructuring must be approved by creditors
  common and preferred holdersand present and former employees
      AllisChalmers said a bankruptcy filing appears to
  represent the companys only alternative if agreement upon the
  terms of the plan cannot be reached
      The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that he was
  not aware of any extraordinary charge against earnings that
  would result from the restructuring
      It is too early to talk about a charge because the plan
  must still be approved by the lenders and unions he said
      Also under the plan payments to AllisChalmers private
  lenders would be deferred Trade payables and obligations
  incurred in the ordinary course of business will be met
      Payment of health benefits for active and retired employees
  would be made at substantially reduced levels
      AllisChalmers once one of the leading farm equipment
  companies sold all of its farm equipment operations to Deutz
  of West Germany for 107 mln dlrs leaving the company with
  businesses in lift trucks air conditioning fluids handling
  and solid materials processing
      Last year AllisChalmers sold the lift truck business to
  AC Material Handling Co of Columbus Ohio
      Under the restructuring plan AllisChalmers will sell its
  solid materials processing and fluids handling businesses
  Solid materials processing which makes equipment to crush
  stones for highway construction accounted for 288 mln dlrs of
  AllisChalmerss total 1985 revenues of 886 mln dlrs
      The company will also sell its fluids handling operations
  which makes pumps and valves That business accounted for 196
  mln dlrs of the companys 1985 revenues
      AllisChalmers in 1986 reported a net loss of 86 mln dlrs
  or 109 dlrs a share In 1985 the company lost 1684 mln dlrs
  or 1227 dlrs a share
