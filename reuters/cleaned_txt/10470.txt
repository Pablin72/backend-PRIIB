GALACTIC ltGALCF ADOPTS CONSERVATIVE ACCOUNTING
  Galactic Resources
  Ltd earlier reporting a 1986 loss of 256 mln US dlrs said
  it adopted a more conservative accounting policy similar to
  other gold producers accounting for exploration costs
      As a result the company retroactively charged all past
  exploration and related administration costs incurred on its
  properties against expenses in 1986 1985 and 1984
      Under the new policy all future exploration and related
  administration costs will be written off to expenses rather
  than capitalized as an intangible asset it said
      Galactic said the accounting change resulted in a 228 mln
  US dlr charge against 1986 earnings It did not immediately
  disclose the affect of the change on prior years results
      The new accounting policy is not expected to adversely
  affect working capital position future cash flows or the
  companys ability to conduct ongoing business operations it
  said
      Galactic said the charge includes 99 mln US dlrs of
  costs concerning its Summitville Mine leach pad and 89 mln
  US dlrs in waste removal costs dyke construction and other
  mine developments
      Galactic said under the prior accounting policy the
  Summitville mine expenses would have been amortized over the
  life of the mine and charged against future earnings
      The change will also result in lower depreciation and
  amortization charges against income of about 52 US dlrs an
  ounce of gold produced in future periods based on total
  estimated reserves of 617000 ounces
      Galactic said March leaching production at Summitville is
  expected to exceed 2500 ounces raising gold equivalent
  production since the June 5 1986 start of leaching to 65000
  ounces
