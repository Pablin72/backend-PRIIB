TORRENTIAL RAINS HALT ARGENTINE GRAIN HARVEST
  Torrential rains throughout
  Argentinas grainproducing areas virtually paralysed coarse
  grain harvesting in the week to yesterday trade sources said
      Sunflower maize and sorghum harvests were particularly
  affected they said But the rains proved to be a great aid to
  soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or
  May
      The rains did no damage to maize sunflower and sorghum
  crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields
  and cut the total volume of this years harvest
      Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires
  with the heaviest rains in the provinces western sectors
  between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa 10
  and 75 mm in Santa Fe 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios five and 40
  mm in Misiones and five and 50 mm in San Luis
      No rain was recorded in Corrientes Chaco and Formosa
      Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of
  the coarse grain harvest over last weeks estimates
      Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa
  Fe though slowly Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of
  total planted area compared to five to seven pct last week
      Total maize area planted for the 198687 harvest was
  estimated at between 358 and 378 mln hectares or two to
  seven pct less than the 385 mln hectares planted in the
  198586 harvest
      Maize production is expected to total between 104 and 11
  mln tonnes or a drop of 175 to 194 pct over the 124 to 126
  mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates
  or 189 to 219 pct lower than last years volume according to
  official figures
      The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine
  pct of total planted area
      Two to 22 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers
  for this harvest down 299 to 363 pct from last years figure
  of 314 mln hectares
      Sunflower production is expected to total between 24 mln
  and 27 mln tonnes which would mean a drop of between 341 and
  415 pct against the record 41 mln tonnes harvested in the
  198586 harvest
      Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and
  four pct of total planted area which this harvest is 123 to
  130 mln hectares or 103 to 152 pct less than the 145 mln
  hectares planted in the 198586 harvest
      Sorghum production is expected to total between 32 mln and
  35 mln tonnes or 167 to 22 pct less than the 41 to 42
  million tonnes harvested in 198586
      Soybean production by contrast is expected to hit a
  record 80 to 84 mln tonnes which would mean an increase of
  111 to 151 pct over last years record figure of 72 to 73
  mln tonnes according to private estimates Official figures
  put last years soybean harvest at 71 mln tonnes
      Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good
  condition helped by abundant rains and high temperatures
      Total soybeanplanted area for the 198687 harvest is
  expected to be a record 37 to 38 mln hectares up 108 to
  138 pct from last years harvest figure of 334 mln hectares
