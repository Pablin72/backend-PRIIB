OECD FARM SUBSIDIES STUDY RESULTS DETAILED
  The results of a controversial study
  of farm subsidies conducted by the Parisbased Organisation for
  Economic Cooperation and Development OECD show Japan has the
  highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy
  farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from
  subsidies
      Results of the study which has not been released by OECD
  because of objections from some countries were provided to
  Reuters by officials of several countries on condition they not
  be identified
      The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies for
  the years 197981 using a new measure called the producer
  subsidy equivalent PSE
      The study shows that on dairy products Japans PSE or the
  amount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage averaged
  833 pct over 197981 with the European Community at 688 pct
  and the United States 482 pct
      For wheat Japans PSE averaged 958 pct the EC 281 and
  the US 172 Japans rice PSE was 688 pct compared to the EC
  136 and the US 54 pct the OECD calculations show
      In coarse grains Japans subsidies reached 1071 pct
  compared with 279 pct for the EC and 131 pct for the US
  Japans beef subsidy was 549 pct versus 527 pct for the EC
  and 95 pct for the US OECD concluded
      For sugar Japans PSE was 484 pct versus 279 pct in the
  EC and 131 pct for the US the study shows
      The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial
  countries such as Canada Australia and New Zealand but in most
  cases the results were much lower than for the US EC and
  Japan the sources said
      Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil two major developing
  country producers of commodities were not included in the OECD
  work
      Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to
  release the study soon perhaps coinciding with the OECD
  ministerial meeting in Paris during May
      Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a 
  basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade
  talks now underway in Geneva
      British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit
  to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting
  point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture
      He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate
  down domestic farm support levels which are a major cause of
  the present crisis in world agriculture
      However the OECD study results are controversial because
  they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers officials
  familiar with the study said
      The US Agriculture Departments Economic Research Service
  recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to
  verify the OECD results and update them to 198284
      In some cases the results were substantially different than
  the OECDs in part because farm policies in both the US and
  elsewhere had changed markedly by 198284 from the OECD base
  period of 197981 US officials said
      For example the USDA study found the United States
  subsidies to corn producers were higher in 198284 at 25 to 49
  pct than in the EC at zero to nine pct
      French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale
  citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn told
  reporters last week that the United States subsidizes its
  farmers more than the EC
      However the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably
  higher than the US now because of increases since 1984
      Officials of several countries have been asked to
  contribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to
  1985 subsidy levels a much more relevant measure of the
  current world farm situation
      The updated calculations which may take several months to
  complete are expected to show substantial increases in US
  subsidy levels for sugar because the US imposed restrictive
  import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry
      US subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm
  bill which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to
  grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice officials
