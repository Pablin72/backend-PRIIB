US FEEDGRAINS GROUP ATTACKS CANADA CORN RULING
  The US Feedgrains Council is
  surprised and disappointed by the Canadian Import Tribunals
  decision that imports of corn from the US are materially
  injuring Canadian corn producers a council spokesman said
      At a time when the world is attempting to liberalize trade
  in the new rounnd of multilateral negotiations it is
  incomprehensible that a country that stands to gain so much
  from the reduction in agricultural trade barriers would
  threaten that process by caving in to pressures for
  protectionism council president Darwin E Stolte said
      Canadas finding will strain the USCanadian trading
  relationship could damage the future of US feedgrains 
  support for the free trade negotiations and also negatively
  impact farm trade reform with other nations the council said
