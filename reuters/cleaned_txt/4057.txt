AWB SAYS AUSTRALIAN WHEAT SALES OVER 10 MLN TONNES
  The Australian Wheat Boards AWB
  198687 export program is well advanced with over 10 mln tonnes
  already sold AWB general manager Ron Paice said
      We are certainly within reach of our 15 mln tonne export
  target for the year he said in a statement
      He did not detail the commitments already made but an AWB
  spokesman said they include sales to Egypt China Iran the
  Soviet Union and Iraq
      In the 198586 wheat year ended September 30 the AWB
  exported a record 1596 mln tonnes
      Paice also said the 198687 Australian wheat harvest has
  ended after a long cool summer with 1514 mln tonnes delivered
  to the AWB
      The season produced another good crop with only 02 pct of
  receivals being downgraded to feed quality he said
      However it is likely that some weatherdamaged grain was
  still being held on farms and further milling and feed wheat
  may be delivered following the recent announcement of the final
  Guaranteed Minimum Price for 198687 he said
      Paice did not give a crop estimate but the AWBs February
  Wheat Australia publication put the crop at 167 mln tonnes
      But the AWB spokesman said it is likely this estimate could
  turn out to be too high based on the receivals level and the
  final crop figure would probably be nearer to 162 mln tonnes
  The official estimate is not yet available
      In the 198586 season the AWB received 1508 mln tonnes of
  the 1613 mln tonne crop
      Another 422000 tonnes was retained onfarm and 620000
  sold under the permit system introduced in 198485 to allow
  farmers to sell feed wheat to the grain trade outside the AWBs
  receival system according to Bureau of Agricultural Economics
