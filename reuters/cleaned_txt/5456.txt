MRS FIELDS PLANS TO OPEN MORE STORES
  US Based speciality food retailer ltMrs
  Fields Inc which earlier announced pretax profits of 171
  mln dlrs in 1986 against 68 mln in 1985 said it plans further
  growth this year with the opening of 125 new stores in the US
      The company which is quoted on Londons Unlisted
  Securities Market USM said it also planned to expand its
  outlets internationally
      However chairman Randall Fields told a news conference the
  company would not move into any new countries during 1987 but
  would intensify its efforts where it already had stores
      During 1986 the company opened 81 new stores including 76
  in the US Two in Australia and one each in Japan Canada and
  the UK
      We intend to open a minimum of five more units in London
  for example and it is reasonable that we might open other
  stores in other European countries in 1988 Fields said
      He said the company acquired competitive businesses as a
  matter of routine and might add others in 1987 but declined
  to say how much the company planned to spend on them
      Last year turnover rose by 208 pct to 871 mln dlrs from
  726 mln dlrs in 1985
