WOOLWORTH UK SAYS GROWTH PROSPECTS EXCITING
  Woolworth Holdings Plc ltWLUKL which
  earlier announced a 1986 pretax profits rise of 42 pct over
  1985 said its prospects for growth were very exciting
      The profit figure of 1153 mln stg exceeded a forecast by
  some 10 pct made during the hostile bid by Dixons Group Plc
  ltDXNSL last year and the company said the results were a
  major step towards the aim of making Woolworth the most
  profitable retailing group in the UK
      It aimed to produce growth from all its businesses and look
  for opportunities to acquire specialist retail businesses
      Earlier this month the group said that tentative merger
  talks with the high street pharmacist ltUnderwoods Plc had been
  called off and recently announced a 192 mln stg recommended
  offer for ltCharlie Browns Car Part Centres Plc
      The B and Q Do it Yourself centres raised sales by 31 pct
  and retail profit by 37 pct with its pretax contribution of
  455 mln making it the largest single component
      The company said that the improvement had been achieved by
  substantial organic growth in existing stores as well as by the
  opening of a further 29 new outlets and enhanced margins
      In other sectors the Comet electrical chain raised retail
  profits by 46 pct to 174 mln stg while the Woolworth chain
  reported a 120 pct improvement to 387 mln
      The company said its property operations would increase
  substantially following the start of a joint venture deal with
  developers ltRosehaugh Plc
      The defence costs against the 19 billion stg bid from
  Dixons resulted in a 160 mln stg extraordinary charge
      The results were 10 mln stg up on most analysts forecasts
  As a result the groups shares rose strongly peaking at 865p
  from last nights 842p before easing to 860p at 1155 GMT
