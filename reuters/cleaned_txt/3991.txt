HARPER ltHPR GETS BID FROM HARCOURT ltHBJ
  Harper and Row Publishers Inc said it
  received an acquisition offer from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
  INc to acquire all of Harper and Rows shares at 50 dlrs a
  share in cash
      Harper said it will consider the proposal including such
  possible concerns as antitrust and other legal considerations
      On Monday Harper and Row received a surprise 34 dlra
  share bid from investor Theodore Cross owner of six pct of the
  shares for the stock he does not own
       Harcourt made clear in its offer that it will step aside
  if Harpers directors and shareholders reject the bid Harper
  said
      Harper said the board has previously expressed a strong
  determination to remain an independent publishing enterprise
      Harper also said that New World Pictures a shareholder
  has requested a copy of Harpers shareholder list to be used in
  soliciting proxies
      New World has 30800 shares of the total 44 mln shares
      Harper and Rows stock closed off 34 to 3312 after
  rising 914 points yesterday
      Shareholders are due to vote April 2 on a shareholders
  rights plan designed to thwart hostile takeovers
      Ivan Obolensky an analyst with the investment banking for
  of Sterling Grace and Co said Harper and Row is one of the few
  remaining independent publishers with a back list of authors
  stretching back 200 years
      He said as long as the company maintains copyrights with
  the estates of deceased authors it controls all motion picture
  and television rights to the stories And he said new printing
  technologies make new editions a profitable business
      Harcourt Brace needs a back list of that nature and is
  willing to pay up for it Obolensky said But he said Harper
  and Row has plenty of beef to warrant a 50 dlr bid
