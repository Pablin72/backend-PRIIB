UNILEVER HAS IMPROVED MARGINS VOLUMES IN 1986
  Unilever Plc ltUNA and NV group reported
  improvements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of
  five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling
  prices disposals and currency movements Unilever Plc chairman
  Michael Angus said
      He told reporters that volumes in North America increased
  some 105 pct while European consumer goods rose about 25 pct
  after being flat for some years
      Much of the disposal strategy aimed at concentrating
  activities on core businesses had now been completed he
  noted
      But the process of acquisitions would go on with strategic
  acquisitions taking place from time to time he said
      The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pretax
  profits for 1986 to 114 billion stg from 953 mln previously
  In guilder terms however profits at the pretax level dropped
  three pct to 369 billion from 381 billion
      Angus said the recent purchase of ChesebroughPonds Inc
  ltCBMN for 7250 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any
  earnings dilution
      However it would not add much to profits with much of the
  companys operating profits paying for the acquisition costs
      Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing
   debt to equity plus debt  rose to about 60 pct at end 1986
  from 35 pct last year this was expected to drop back to about
  40 pct by end1987
      The same divergence was made in full year dividend with
  Unilever NVs rising 34 pct to 1533 guilders and Unilever
  Plcs increasing 299 pct to 5017p approximately in line with
  the change in attributable profit
      Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of
  Chesebrough was due to be published shortly However he said
  that there was no target date for completing the process
      He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to
  realise from the operation beyond noting that Chesebrough had
  paid around 125 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co which
  operates outside Unilevers core activities
      In the US Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business
  considerable expansion in the household products business and
  in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase
      However he noted that the US Household products business
  had turned in a planned loss with fourth quarter performance
  better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs
  of its Surf detergents
