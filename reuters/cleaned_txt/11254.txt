US MAY DROP TARIFFS IF JAPAN OPENS  YEUTTER
  The US Is willing to drop tariffs on
  Japanese electronic imports if Japan shows it will abide by an
  agreemement opening its markets to American goods US Trade
  Representative Clayton Yeutter said in a TV interview
      But there has to be a clear indication that they are
  willing to act he said
      Yeutter said difficulties in the Japanese economy caused by
  the US Tariffs and the yens rise against the dollar are
  problems they have brought on themselves
      The dollar fell to 40year lows against the yen today
      Certainly the movement of the yen is causing some economic
  turmoil in Japan he said My only response is that we have
  gone through about five years with the dollar going in just the
  opposite direction Although I can sympathise its occurred
  for only a few weeks or months in Japan
      The tarriffs announced on Friday by President Reagan will
  affect about 300 million dlrs worth of products only a tiny
  fraction of Japans total exports to the US
      Even so Reagans decision doesnt give us any joy We
  dont want to take retaliatory action here if we dont have to
  Yeutter said
      Yeutter said the meetings scheduled next month in
  Washington between Reagan and Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
  will include some difficult items on the agenda
      Japan has failed to implement two parts of a threepart
  semiconductor agreement Yeutter said
      Japan has stopped dumping chips in the US But it has
  failed to open its domestic markets to USmade chips and has
  failed to end predatory pricing in Third World countries
  undercutting US Products he said
