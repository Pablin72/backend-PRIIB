JAPAN SEAMLESS PIPE MAKERS TO FORM EXPORT CARTEL
  Four major Japanese steelmakers plan to
  form a seamless pipe export cartel for markets other than the
  US And the European Community for a year from April to keep
  prices above output costs company officials involved said
      The companies are Nippon steel Corp ltNSTCT Sumitomo
  Metal Industries Ltd ltSMITT Nippon Kokan KK ltNKKTT and
  Kawasaki Steel Corp ltKAWST which together account for some
  95 pct of Japans total seamless pipe exports
      The firms will apply to form the cartel to the Ministry of
  International Trade and Industry today and approval is expected
  later this month the officials said
      Under the plan the four companies will set floor prices
  for exports as prices have fallen sharply due to the yens
  appreciation against the dollar reduced world demand caused by
  lower oil prices and excess domestic capacity which resulted in
  pricecutting competition the officials said
      In calendar 1986 seamless pipe exports fell to 234 mln
  tonnes from 299 mln in 1985 and 312 mln in 1981
      The officials declined to give any idea of floor prices
  saying it depends partly on volume but industry sources
  estimate average export prices would rise by around 20 pct to
  some 800 dlrs a tonne
