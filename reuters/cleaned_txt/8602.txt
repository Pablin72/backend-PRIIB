NAKASONE INTERVENES IN MICROCHIP DISPUTE WITH US
  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
  intervened to try to resolve Japans escalating dispute with
  the US Over semiconductor trade government officials said
      At todays Cabinet meeting Nakasone told Trade and
  Industry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calm
  US Anger over what it sees as Japans unfair trade practices
  in semiconductors
      Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled
  meeting of the Reagan administrations Economic Policy Council
  to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact
  with the US
      That pact agreed last year after months of negotiations
  calls on Japan to stop selling cutprice chips in world markets
  and to raise its imports of US Semiconductors
      Senior US Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live
  up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action
      Yesterday Tamuras Ministry of International Trade and
  Industry MITI launched a lastditch attempt to salvage the
  pact by writing letters to US Policy makers setting out
  Japans case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output
      In his letter the contents of which were released today
  Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March
  showed Japanese producers were not selling at cutrate prices
  in Asian markets
      In a separate letter sent to senior US Officials MITI
  vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested
  the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into
  allegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets
