CATHAY PACIFIC 1986 PROFIT SEEN ABOVE TARGET
  Buoyed by low fuel prices and
  favourable currency factors Cathay Pacific Airways Ltds
  ltCAPHHK 1986 profits are expected to surpass the airlines
  forecast of one billion HK Dlrs stock analysts said
      Analysts said they expect the airline to show net earnings
  of between 11 billion and 125 billion dlrs when it reports
  results tomorrow for its first year as a public company
      Cathay 51 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd ltSWPCHK made
  its earnings forecast in the prospectus for its flotation in
  May last year
      Cathay is expected to pay a 13cent final dividend making
  a total of 19 cents for the year as forecast in the
  prospectus analysts polled by Reuters said
      They said the airlines performance improved in the second
  half of the year after it reported interim profits of 503 mln
  dlrs
      The weakness of the local currency pegged at 780 to one
  US Dollar and low fuel prices moved further in the companys
  favour from the assumptions made in the prospectus at the time
  of the flotation James Capel Far East Ltd said
      James Capel estimates average fuel prices for the airline
  industry in 1986 at 63 US Cents per gallon 27 pct below the
  1985 level It said a one pct movement in fuel prices would
  affect Cathays net profits by 10 mln dlrs and forecast profits
  of 125 billion dlrs
       Analysts said the companys estimates of fuel price and
  currency movements set out in its prospectus were conservative
      This is reflected in their interim results which showed
  that profit margin has increased said Frederick Tsang of
  Mansion House Securities FE Ltd
      Cathays sixmonth turnover rose 198 pct from yearearlier
  levels but profits rose 69 pct
      The rise in oil prices in late 1986 had little impact on
  the companys fuel oil bill last year as aviation fuel prices
  usually lag behind crude price movements by several months
  analysts said
      By last September the yen had risen some 54 pct against the
  Hong Kong dollar from the end of 1985 the mark 43 pct and
  sterling 12 pct
      Overall the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar against
  Cathays major trading currencies helped push passenger yields
  in the first half up 72 pct said James Capel This should
  continue through the second half to enable passenger yields to
  end the year up 76 pct
      A strong performance from the 29 billion dlrs in cash
  under management also improved profits James Capel said
      A general improvement in air traffic last year contributed
  to Cathays revenue increase but the companys load factor
  declined because of increased competition and an expansion of
  its fleet and services
      James Capel estimated Cathays passengerkilometres flown
  last year rose six pct from 1985 and freightkilometres flown
  climbed 17 pct though the airlines load factor probably fell
  to 688 pct from 70 pct
      Cathay added new planes and was forced to fly some routes
  last year because of the threat of competition from Dragon Air
  said Tsang This affected its load factor
      Fear of possible competition from fledgling carrier ltHong
  Kong Dragon Airways Ltd may have contributed to Cathays
  decision to resume service to New Zealand last year analysts
  said
