  levels management board spokesman Maximilian Hackl said
      He told the annual news conference that possible credit

  marks and others costs had increased 94 pct to 272 mln marks

  two pct to 671 mln marks

  billion marks at end1986 compared with end1985 Hackl said
      It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgage

      The mortgage sectors share in total parent bank business
  volume rose to 46 pct from 45
      Hackl said that in January and February this year the

  account had increased in the first two 1987 months compared
  with the same yearago period He gave no detailed figures
