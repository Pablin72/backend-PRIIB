KOREA PLANS TO OPEN MARKETS TO EASE WON PRESSURE
  South Korea will further open its market
  to help cut its trade surplus with the US And to fight off
  pressure to revalue the won against the dollar a government
  spokesman said
      The spokesman said Korean trade minister Rha WoongBaes
  stand in Washington yesterday against pressure from industrial
  nations to revalue the won underlined the governments
  determination to stand firm
      Rha told the US Chamber of Commerce Demands that Korea
  carry out a drastic and sudden currency revaluation of five or
  10 pct are I believe extremely illadvised
      Deputy prime minister Kim MahnJe told a meeting of local
  businessmen The governments policy on the question of
  revaluing the won is to maintain a steadfast position
      Kim said South Korea was ready to move slowly to raise the
  wons value because of its heavy foreign debt which stood at
  445 billion dlrs at the end of 1986
      Six industrialised nations agreed in Paris last month that
  newly industrialising countries such as South Korea and
  Taiwan should allow their currencies to appreciate
      But local businessmen have said wondollar parity has
  already reached a crisis level
      An official of the Korea Traders Association KTA said if
  the won strengthened another five pct this would mean the loss
  of profitability for nearly half of all South Korean exporters
      We are determined not to go the way of Latin American
  debtor nations which have suspended interest payments of their
  debts the spokesman said The only way to keep our good record
  is to maintain our exports
      The trade minister said yesterday should Seoul revalue the
  won suddenly Korea would run a tremendous trade deficit and
  could degenerate into a country like many other developing
  countries which is reneging on its international obligations
      The spokesman said South Korea had been gradually
  appreciating its currency ruling out a major revaluation So
  far this year the won has gone up by 08 pct against the
  dollar after a 334 pct revaluation in 1986
      He said South Korea was selecting many of 122 items on
  which Washington recently asked Seoul to lower tariffs to help
  narrow its trade surplus with the US No further details were
  given
      Seoul announced in January the lifting of bans on 158
  items including sensitive agricultural products and large
  cars effective from July
      South Korea posted its first ever current account surplus
  last year due largely to a trade surplus with the US Of 71
  billion dlrs against a 43 billion deficit in 1985 It earlier
  forecast that its current account surplus could reach eight
  billion dlrs this year
      But the government official said the surplus would be held
  at around five billion dlrs to avoid further pressure by
  industrialised nations to push up the value of its currency
