NORANDA SETS TEMPORARY MINE SHUTDOWN
  ltNoranda Inc said
  production will remain shut down at its firedamaged copper
  mine here until it can completely examine the mine
      The fire which started Wednesday and burned itself out
  late yesterday killed one miner and trapped 56 others
  underground for about 24 hours The 56 were eventually brought
  safely out of the mine
      Company spokesman Dale Coffin said the investigation could
  take from a few days to several weeks but would not be more
  specific
      Noranda said that when it resumes production it plans to
  operate the mine at about onethird of the normal 72000 metric
  tons annual finished capacity
      The fire weakened part of the mines support structure
  Coffin said
      Noranda said if it decides to keep the mine open it would
  take four or five months before it could resume full
  production
