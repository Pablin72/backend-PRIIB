SNET ltSNG SEES GOOD 1987 EARNINGS
  Southern New England Telecommunications
  Corp SNET said it expects to have good earnings in 1987
  against 446 dlrs per share or 1392 mln dlrs in 1986
      The company also said it expects capital spending to rise
  to about 355 mln dlrs in 1987 up from 289 mln dlrs a year ago
      However senior vice president of finance Daniel Miglio
  told a meeting of analysts that there was some uncertainty in
  its earnings outlook because SNET is currently involved in
  negotiations with state regulators on its rate of return on
  equity which currently stands at 162 pct
      The company also said it expects its SNET Systems business
  which is composed of some of its nonregulated businesses to
  be profitable by the end of the year
