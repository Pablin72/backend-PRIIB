KEY US HOUSE PANEL FINISHES MAJOR TRADE BILL
  The House Ways and Means Committee
  completed action on legislation to toughen US trade laws
  chairman Dan Rostenkowski said
      The committees consideration of one of the most
  controversial provisions a plan to force major trade surplus
  countries to cut their trade imbalance with the United States
  was deferred until the full House considers the trade bill its
  sponsor Rep Richard Gephardt said
      Gephardt a Missouri Democrat told Reuters he was not
  certain the exact form his trade surplus reduction proposal
  would take Last year the House approved his plan to force a 10
  pct surplus cutback each year for four years by countries such
  as Japan
      The Ways and Means Committess trade bill forces President
  Reagan to retaliate against unfair trade practices that violate
  international trade agreements but it allows him to wave
  retaliatory tariffs or quotas if the action would hurt the US
  economy
      The trade bill gives US Trade Representative Clayton
  Yeutter more authority in trade negotiations and in decisions
  to grant domestic industries import relief
      It also gives him authority to decide whether foreign trade
  practices are unfair and violate US trading rights These
  powers are currently held by President Reagan
      The administration has strongly objected to this transfer
  of authority from Reagan to Yeutter
      The bill also extends US authority to negotiate
  multilateral trade agreements The bill will be wrapped into
  other trade legislation and voted on in the House in April
