  business to Agricola Finanziaria SpA a member of the Ferruzzi
  Group for a price in excess of 600 mln dlrs
      The transaction is expected to be completed by September
  30
      CPC said it expects no material gain or loss this year from
  the transaction But the effect of the deal on 1987 earnings
  can be evaluated in full only when the definitive pacts are
  completed it said
      The longterm effect of the transaction on CPCs earnings
  should be positive it added as it will allow capital
  expenditures to be cut back and will reduce corporate and
  divisional overheads as well as operating expenses in the
  European business
      The sale is an important part of a restructuring announced
  in November CPC said
      Proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt incurred
  in the purchase of the Arnold Foods and Old London specialty
  baking businesses and the stock repurchase program that was 
  part of the restructuring
      As of December 31 CPC had bought about 15 mln of its
  common shares adjusted for a 2for1 split in January for a
  total cost of 6218 mln dlrs according to its 1986 annual
  report
      In December CPC acquired Arnold Foods and Old London for a
  total of about 170 mln dlrs
      CPC had previously said it wanted to sell the European corn
  wet milling business and use the proceeds to help reduce debt
  including that incurred under the share buyback
      In total CPC has bought back about 16 mln shares of common
  stock adjusted for the split it said today In November it
  authorized a buyback of 20 mln shares adjusted for the split
      The buyback and the restructuring were triggered in
  November after companies controlled by Ronald Perelman
  chairman of Revlon Group Inc ltREV acquired about 76 pct of
  CPCs then outstanding stock
      In 1986 the European corn wet milling business had sales
  of 9141 mln dlrs operating income before overheads of 688
  mln dlrs and associated headquarters overhead costs of 197 mln
