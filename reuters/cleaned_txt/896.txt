BANKERS SEE SHARP RISE IN THAI FOREIGN RESERVES
  Thailands improving economy will likely
  cause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billion
  dlrs by end1987 from a record of nearly 42 billion at
  endFebruary private bankers said
      Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to
  395 billion at endJanuary from 303 billion a year earlier
      Nimit Nonthapanthawat chief economist at the ltBangkok Bank
  Ltd said Thailands strong export performance its relatively
  high interest rates foreign participation in its stock market
  and growing foreign investment especially from Japan
  contributed to the projected sharp rise
      Thai exports rose 194 pct in 1986 and are expected to
  expand another 15 pct this year bankers said
      A US Embassy report said last month Thailand could
  achieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987 up
  from a projection of 38 pct for 1986 and 37 pct in 1985
      Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at its
  current pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stable
  the five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached
      Thailand calculates foreign reserves to include gold
  special drawing rights and convertible currencies The target
  is equivalent to fiveandahalf months worth of imports
