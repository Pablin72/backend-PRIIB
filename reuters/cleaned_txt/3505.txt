PREUSSAG SAYS PAYMENT OF A 1986 DIVIDEND NOT CERTAIN
  A spokesman for Preussag
  AG ltPRSGF said it was not yet certain whether the company
  would pay a dividend on 1986 results
      He was commenting on a Preussag statement which said
  results in 1986 were lower than in 1985 Preussag has
  frequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986
  following a difficult year in 1985
      Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said in
  December the board would prefer to stick to its policy of not
  dipping into reserves to pay dividends The spokesman noted the
  final dividend decision rests with the supervisory board
      The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared
  with 1985 because declines in earnings in metals oil and
  shipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in
  the groups other divisions
      The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic
  group would show a net profit in 1986 adding this would depend
  partly on the level of provisions
      Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine
  marks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped
  to 650 mln marks from 1030 mln the year before
      The Preussag world group made a net loss of 131 mln marks
  in 1985 after a net profit of 1545 mln the year before
  Domestic group net profit fell to 779 mln from 1222 mln
      The statement said its results in 1986 were affected by
  unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by
  poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector
      The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter
  of 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an
  additional factor behind the drop in results
      Preussag said rationalization measures already introduced
  would not begin to take full effect until this year
      Preussags domestic group turnover rose to 448 billion
  marks in 1986 from 429 billion in 1985 helped by the first
  time consolidation of 9518 mln marks of turnover from its
  majorityowned oil and gas subsidiary C Deilmann AG
      Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone
  was 11 billion marks it said without giving comparison
  figures
      Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 40
  pct to 94400 tonnes in 1986 while foreign oil production rose
  to 182900 tonnes from 174500 tonnes
      Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc AMC
  subsidiary whose results are included in the world group
  accounts made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of
  last year
      AMCs large losses in 1985 caused principally by the
  international tin crisis were the reason behind the world
  group losses that year
