GERMAN CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS WIDENS IN FEBRUARY
  West Germanys current account
  surplus widened to a provisional 66 billion marks in February
  from a slightly downwards revised 48 billion in January a
  spokeswoman for the Federal Statistics Office said
      The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 104
  billion marks from 72 billion in January she added
      The Statistics Office had originally put the January
  current account surplus at 49 billion marks
      The February trade surplus was well up on the 684 billion
  mark surplus posted in the same month of 1986 But the current
  account surplus was down slightly from the 685 billion surplus
  recorded in February 1986
      A Statistics Office statement said the widening of the
  February current account surplus compared with January was due
  to seasonal factors Neither the trade nor current account
  figures are seasonally adjusted
      February imports measured in terms of value totalled
  3211 billion marks a decline of 10 pct against February 1986
  but a rise of 55 pct against January
      Exports in February also in value terms totalled 4256
  billion marks 05 pct less than in February 1986 but up 13 pct
  compared with January
      The Statistics Office said it was not yet able to calculate
  the real change in exports and imports in February But for
  comparison purposes it noted that in January the average value
  of imports had fallen 15 pct yearonyear while the average
  value of exports had declined by only 44 pct
      Within the current account the services account had 300
  mln marks deficit supplementary trade items a 200 mln mark
  surplus while transfer payments posted a 37 billion mark
  deficit
      Taking the first two months of 1987 together imports in
  value terms fell 14 pct to 626 billion marks compared with a
  year earlier The value of exports totalled 802 billion marks
  a decline of 74 pct against the same months of 1986
      The resulting trade surplus of 176 billion marks for
  JanuaryFebruary compares with a cumulative surplus of 141
  billion marks in the yearago period
      The cumulative current account surplus for January and
  February 1987 totalled 113 billion marks against 114 billion
  marks a year earlier the Statistics Office said
      Bank economists said the rise in the February trade surplus
  reflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well as
  seasonal factors The Federal Statistics Office said earlier
  this week that February import prices fell 07 pct against
  January while export prices were unchanged
      The rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trend
  that is not expected to change for several months at least
  said an economist He said the nominal trade surplus for 1987
  as a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record
  1122 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said the
  surplus could fall to around 80 billion marks
      An economist at the Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft BfG in
  Frankfurt said a twomonth comparison of trade figures gave a
  more accurate picture of West Germanys trade position
      He noted the 176 billion mark surplus for January and
  February together was lower than the 216 billion mark surplus
  posted in November and December
      The trend is clearly lower he said
      This economist who declined to be named said the February
  rise was also partly explained by special factors in January
  when there had been a number of public holidays as well as
  extremely cold weather both of which hindered trade
