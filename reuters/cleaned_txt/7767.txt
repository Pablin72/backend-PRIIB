GERMAN MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH SLOWS IN FEBRUARY
  West Germanys money supply growth
  slowed in February after Januarys sharp rise but the trend is
  still definitely upward the Bundesbank said in a statement
      Growth in the traditionally broad M3 aggregate was only
  moderate in February While cash in circulation deposits with
  statutory withdrawal notice and sight deposits grew sharply
  shortterm time deposits fell after expanding unusually
  strongly in January
      In the six months to February M3 which excludes holdings
  of German nonbanks abroad grew at a seasonally adjusted
  annual rate of 85 pct after 98 in the six months to January
      Compared with February 1986 M3 rose 712 pct
      In the six months to February M2 which excludes time
  deposits with statutory withdrawal notice rose at a seasonally
  adjusted annual rate of 88 pct and M1 which consists of cash
  and sight deposits rose seven pct
      International transactions of nonbanks again led to a
  significant inflow of funds the Bundesbank said
      Net claims of commercial banks and the Bundesbank against
  foreigners refecting these foreign payments increased by 91
  billion marks in February little changed from Januarys rise
      But in contrast to January the dampening effect of the
  inflow on domestic credit demand outweighed the expansionary
  effect on money growth the Bundesbank said
      Outstanding bank credits to companies and private
  individuals remained virtually unchanged in February
      A sharp drop in shortterm company credits which reflected
  the foreign funds inflow was balanced by a moderate rise in
  longterm credits and a sharp rise in credits for securities
      At the end of February total bank credits to the private
  sector were 412 pct above the February 1986 level
      The effect of public authority cash movements on the money
  supply was slightly expansive the Bundesbank said
      Although banks acquired large amounts of public authority
  paper public authorities drew down book credits at commercial
  banks and the Bundesbank
      Capital formation strengthened in February and slowed money
  supply growth to a larger extent than in January
      A total of 77 billion marks in longterm funds was placed
  with banks after 66 billion the previous month
