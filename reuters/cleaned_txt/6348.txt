KUWAIT SAYS NO OPEC MEMBER VIOLATING OUTPUT QUOTA
  Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Ali
  alKhalifa alSabah said in a newspaper interview that no OPEC
  member was exceeding oil production quotas allocated by the
  13nation group
      Sheikh Ali told Kuwaits daily alAnba All OPEC states
  without exception are producing within the quotas allocated to
  them Some of them are producing less
      Some oil industry sources had said the United Arab
  Emirates which had been generally been producing over its
  quota since OPEC returned to quotas last September was still
  pumping more than its allotted amount in the first months of
  this year
      Ecuador had also publicly stated it was over its quota but
  an earthquake early this month stopped that Iraq has rejected
  its quota but oil sources say it may be having problems
  marketing at official prices all the oil it wants to sell
      OPEC agreed in December to cut overall oil production by
  725 pct to 158 mln barrels per day bpd for the first six
  months of this year and abide by fixed prices around 18 dlrs a
  barrel from February 1
