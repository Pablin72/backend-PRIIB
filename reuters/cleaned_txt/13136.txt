SCOTT INSTRUMENTS ltSCTI GETS QUALIFIED AUDIT
  Scott Instruments Corp said its
  independent public accountants qualified the report on Scotts
  1986 financial statements because of its weak financial
  condition
      The report indicates the realization of the companys
  assets is dependent on it obtaining enough working capital to
  finance operations and additional funds to meet other
  liabilities among other things
      These factors indicate the company may be unable to
  continue its existence
      Earlier Scott reported a 1986 loss of 19 mln dlrs
  compared to a loss of almost 22 mln dlrs in 1985 Total assets
  were nearly 11 mln dlrs at year end down from 12 mln dlrs
  the prior year
