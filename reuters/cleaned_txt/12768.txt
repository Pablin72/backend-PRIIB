ROTTERDAMS MAIN GRAIN TERMINAL CLOSED BY STRIKE
  Grain handling at Rotterdam ports
  main grain terminal was at a standstill today as members of the
  largest Dutch transport union FNV staged a lightning strike for
  the third day running
      Pieter van der Vorm managing director of Graan Elevator
  Mij GEM which handles 95 pct of grain passing through the
  port said their main Europoort terminal was out of action
  because of a strike by technical staff
      The actions in support of union demands in negotiations
  over a new labour agreement began on Wednesday when grain
  handlers stopped work
      Van der Vorm said that if strikes continued on todays
  scale for some time vessels coming to unload grain in Rotterdam
  would face delays but this was not happening yet
      Wednesdays actions left GEMs facilities 40 pct
  operational and there were only limited strikes yesterday
      Talks between unions and employers yesterday and today
  produced no result but FNV spokesman Bert Duim said the union
  was prepared to put their key demand for a 36 hour working
  week at the bottom of the agenda
      Van der Vorm said however the unions demands on a range
  of issues were far in excess of the managements final offer
