NO HEAVY COFFEE EXPORT IMPLIEDCOLOMBIA OFFICIAL
  A decision by Colombia to open coffee
  export registrations for an unlimited amount does not imply the
  country will heavily sell coffee until recently withheld
  Gilberto Arango president of the private exporters
  association told Reuters
      Colombia today opened export registrations for april and
  may with the National Coffee Growers Federation setting no
  limit
      Since the start of the coffee year last october private
  exporters were on average allowed 350000 bags of 60 kilos per
  month
      Traders will initially interpret this measure as announcing
  heavy sales Even today it pressured the market But it will
  quickly become apparent that Colombia does not intend to go
  over the top Arango said in an interview
      Colombias marketing policy is to sell without haste but
  consistently No targets for volume will be set We will react
  to market factors adequately Colombia has no intention to give
  its coffee away he added
      Arango described measures adopted here yesterday including
  a lower export registration price as a major change in
  Colombias coffee marketing policy
      The export registration price or reintegro was lowered to
  110 dlr per lb exdock new york or 15583 dlrs per bag of 70
  kilos from 135 dlrs 19433 dlrs
      The government announced a more flexible policy of
  reintegro in order to closely reflect market trends which
  arango warmly welcomed saying private exporters will
  undoubtedly be more actively present in the market
      A frequent gap between international market prices and the
  reintegro was unlikely to recur he said
