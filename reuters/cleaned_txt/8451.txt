  industrial goods fell 11 pct seasonally adjusted to 2132
  billion francs last month from 2155 billion in January the
  National Statistics Institute INSEE said
      This brought consumption back down to the December 1986
  level it added
      INSEE said that the fall was due to a sharp decline in
  purchases of clothing which were high in January due to the
  cold weather The decline was partly compensated by a small
  rise in purchases of durable goods
