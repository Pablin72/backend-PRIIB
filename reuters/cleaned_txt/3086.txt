  Gencorp said its RKO General
  subsidiary agreed to sell KHJTV in Los Angeles to Walt Disney
  Co ltDIS for 217 mln dlrs cash plus working capital and other
  adjustments at closing
      The company said under the agreement in principle RKOs
  application to renew the stations broadcast license would be
  dismissed and the competing application of Fidelity Television
  would be granted Disney would then acquire privately held
  Fidelity for about 103 mln dlrs and other adjustments
      Renewal of the KHJTV license has been challenged in
  regulatory proceedings for more than 20 years
      The deal is subject to prior approval by the Federal
  Communications Commission the company said
      Late in 1985 Gencorp cut a deal with Fidelity a Los
  Angeles investor group and Westinghouse Electric Corp ltWX to
  settle the license proceedings and sell KHJTV for 313 mln
  dlrs 70 pct of which would go to Westinghouse and the
  remainder to Fidelity But on Jan 28 1987 Westinghouse
  withdrew from the deal because the FCC would not approve it
      In early 1986 Gencorp and RKO agreed to sell WORTV in
  Secaucus NJ to MCA Inc ltMCA for 387 mln dlrs The FCC has
  approved the transaction but several parties have appealed
      The FCC has not said when it would rule on the appeals
  according to a spokemsan for Akron Ohiobased Gencorp
      Fidelity Television originally filed a competing
  application for the RKO license for KHJ an independent
  station in 1965
      In 1980 the FCC disqualified RKO as licensee of WNACTV in
  Boston citing anticompetitive trade practices and inaccurate
  financial reporting to the agency causing renewals previously
  granted to RKO in New York for WOR and Los Angeles for KHJ
  to be denied
