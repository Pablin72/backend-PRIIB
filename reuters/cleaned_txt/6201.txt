UK OIL REVENUE FORECAST TO FALL IN 198788
  The UK Government forecasts that oil
  revenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year
  198788 from 475 billion in 198687 and 115 billion in
  198586
      The forecast came in the Treasurys Financial Statement and
  Budget Report issued after the Chancellor of the Exchequer
  Nigel Lawsons annual budget statement to parliament
      The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15
  dlrs a barrel in line with its earlier forecasts and its oil
  revenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remaining
  close to current levels the Treasury document said
      The Treasury said the 198788 oil revenue shortfall will
  reflect the oil price fall of 1986 as North Sea corporation
  tax is paid after a time lag
      The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel difference
  in oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mln
  stg for the current fiscal year and 400 mln stg in a full
  year
      Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987
  according to the statement A change in one mln tonnes in
  production would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 198788
  and 50 mln stg in a full year it added
      Total general government receipts for 198687 are now
  estimated to be 1592 billion stg 275 billion more than the
  1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts
  despite a shortfall of 125 billlion in oil receipts
      Additional nonNorth Sea corporation tax of 175 billion
  stg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of the
  overshoot
      Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to
  1688 billion stg in fiscal 198788 and among the main items
  besides diminishing oil revenues were projected income tax of
  40 billion stg up from 384 billion in the current year
      NonNorth Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 135
  billion stg in 198788 after the revised 112 billion in
  198687 and VAT revenue should amount to 233 billion
  compared with upwardly revised estimated 215 billion this
  fiscal year
      The general government expenditure for the coming fiscal
  year is expected to total 1735 billion stg up from a revised
  1649 billion in the current year
      A repayment of 800 mln on public corporations market and
  overseas borrowings is forecast to bring the total Public
  Sector Borrowing Requirement down to 39 billion stg in
  198788 from this years revised 41 billion the Treasury
  said
