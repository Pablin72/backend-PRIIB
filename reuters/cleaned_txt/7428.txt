  large single day net misses in the Feds reserve projections in
  the first week of the latest bank statement period
      None of the 14 large money center banks borrowed from the
  discount window during the week and all of the Wednesday
  borrowing was made by the smallest banks For the week as a
  whole the borrowing was split roughly evenly between the large
  regionals and the small banks

  for which the Fed spokesman could give no particular reason 
  to a high of nearly 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday

  transportation float in mid and southAtlantic states Noting
  that the weather was basically good for March the spokesman
  said that transportation float averaged under 500 mln dlrs a
  day for the full week
      Float related asofs were a negative 400 mln dlrs on
  Wenesday due to a number of unrelated cash letter error
  corrections in five districts
