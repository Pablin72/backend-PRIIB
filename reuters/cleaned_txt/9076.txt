CANADA VOWS TO FIGHT US POTASH ACTION
  External Affairs Minister Joe Clark
  today vowed to do everything possible to fight the US action
  against Canadian potash exports but also warned against
  raising the alarm too early in the dispute
      In the latest flashpoint in CanadianUS trade relations
  the US International Trade Commission ruled unanimously
  Monday that Canadian potash shipments valued at 270 million
  US dlrs last year were injuring the US industry
      We certainly intend to do everything we can to insure that
  Canadian interests are well protected Clark told the House of
  Commons in the daily question period
      But he said the opposition parties should be careful not
  to raise false alarms too early
      The case now goes before the US Commerce Departments
  trade division to determine if a duty should be imposed Potash
  producers from New Mexico claiming unfair government
  subsidies are seeking a 43 pct tariff on Canadas shipments
      Canada the worlds largest potash producer exported 98
  mln metric tonnes of potash last year with nearly a third
  going to the US
      Most of the potash used in the production of fertilizer
  comes from provincially owned mines in Saskatchewan
      In the Commons Liberal member Lloyd Axworthy branded the
  ruling as just another trade harrassment from the US and
  criticized Clarks assurances the countrys interests would be
  protected
      We received exactly the same kind of assurances in the
  softwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled
  Axworthy said
      Canadas Progressive Conservative government agreed to
  impose a 15 pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlier
  this year to end a long and bitter bilateral trade dispute with
  the US
      Axworthy urged the government to present Canadas case to
  world trade authorities under the General Agreement on Tariffs 
  and Trade
      But Clark maintained the potash dispute was another example
  of why Canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateral
  irritants in the free trade negotiations under way with the
  US
      What we are seeking to do is put in place a better
  system Clark said
      Meanwhile Saskatchewan Trade Minister Bob Andrew expressed
  confidence Canada would win its case claiming the problem
  stems from low international commodity prices and not
  government subsidies
      The reality of the problem and the injury is caused
  worldwide he said Its caused by a downturn in the
  commodity price for fertilizer whether its potash fertilizer
  nitrogen fertilizer or whatever
