WALL STREET STOCKSSUPERMARKETS GENERAL ltSGL
  Dart Group Corp ltDARTA which wants
  to acquire Supermarkets General Corp for 162 billion dlrs is
  not likely to give up without a fight if its target seeks
  another buyer arbitrageurs said
      Speculation that Darts offer of 4175 dlrs per share could
  be just the beginning of a bidding contest helped Supermarkets
  shares gain one to 4218  on 23 mln shares
      One rumor had Federated Department Stores Inc ltFDS taking
  a look at Supermarkets General Our policy is that we do not
  comment on any rumors or speculation of this nature a
  Federated spokeswoman said
      An arbitrageur noted that Dart controlled by chairman
  Herbert H Haft and his son Robert last year raised its
  initial bid for Safeway Stores by approximately 10 pct when
  Safeway resisted
      However that company was later sold to a buyout group that
  topped the Hafts
      If history repeats itself the Hafts could raise their bid
  to 46 dlrs if they are rebuffed by Supermarkets General the
  arbitrageur said But another arbitrageur said the Hafts
  present bid seemed quite fair He said the offer amounts to
  10 times aftertaxcash flow which is probably fully priced
