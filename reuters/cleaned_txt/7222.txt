FRENCH INSTITUTE PESSIMISTIC ON 1987 GROWTH
  French gross domestic product will grow
  by only 15 pct in real terms this year compared with the
  governments forecast of two to 25 pct growth the private
  Institut des Previsions Economiques et Financieres pour le
  Developpement des Entreprises IPECODE said
      However it expects growth to recover next year to the 1986
  level of two pct
      IPECODE said demand and production would develop in
  parallel this year in contrast to last year when production
  was unable to keep pace with the strong rise in domestic
  demand unleashing higher import demand
      Claims on the International Monetary Fund IMF rose by 298
  mln francs to 1961 billion francs due to net withdrawals in
  francs by member nations and an increase in reserves of
  Special Drawing Rights SDRs due mainly to the repayment of
  French debts
      Its deficit with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund
  FECOM remained unchanged in February at 3390 billion francs
      French household consumption which rose by 31 pct last
  year is likely to grow by just 11 pct this year and 15 pct
  in 1988 it added
      Industrial investment is expected to rise by 43 pct this
  year and 55 pct in 1988 down from 65 pct in 1986
      Inflation which was running at 21 pct at the end of 1986
  is likely to rise to 29 pct at the end of this year IPECODE
  said while the government has forecast 25 pct
      However the institute said inflation would fall back to
  25 pct at the end of 1988 provided that real wage costs
  remain within the framework of productivity rises
