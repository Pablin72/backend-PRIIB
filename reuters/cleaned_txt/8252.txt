JAPAN IN LAST DITCH EFFORT TO SAVE CHIP PACT
  Japan has launched a lastditch effort to
  salvage its computer microchip pact with the United States 
  sending a letter to top American policy makers setting out its
  case and instructing its producers to cut output further
      We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe
  Ministry of International Trade and Industry MITI Deputy
  Director General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters
      If hasty action is taken in the United States it will
  create very serious problems
      The Reagan Administrations Economic Policy is expected to
  meet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateral
  agreement hammered out last year Under the pact Tokyo agreed
  to stop selling cutprice chips in world markets and to
  increase its imports of American semiconductors
      Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal by
  selling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boost
  American imports and has threatened to take retaliatory
  action
      In an effort to save the agreement MITI is asking Japanese
  chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost
  domestic demand and reduce the incentive to export
      Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobit
  dynamic random access and erasable programmable read only
  memory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter This follows a
  cutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of the
  year
      He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of
  chips available for export through unregulated distributors in
  the socalled grey market
      We have almost no grey market he said Supply is
  diminishing
      To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented MITI
  called in the president of Japans largest semiconductor maker
  NEC Corp ltNIPNT last week he said It is also issuing
  specific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiary
  of ltTexas Instruments Inc
      Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out the
  steps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed for
  US Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers
      The letter was sent today to US Secretary of State George
  Schultz Treasury Secretary James Baker Commerce Secretary
  Malcolm Baldrige and US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
      The four who make up the Economic Policy Council are
  expected to consider evidence presented by US Chip maker
  Micron Technology Inc ltDRAMO of cutprice Japanese sales in
  Hong Kong
      Yamamoto admitted that ltOki Electric Industry Cos Hong
  Kong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level but
  denied that it was dumping chips at rockbottom prices
      If the United States uses this as proof of dumpingWe
  will present our rebuttal he said
      The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITIs
  advice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well above
  production costs to avoid any hint of dumping he said
      He also called the case strange but he stopped short of
  endorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had been
  trapped into making the sales He did say though that Micron
  publicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same day
  they were made and that Oki was unable to locate the person who
  had bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week
