OECD TRADE GROWTH SEEN SLOWING IN 1987
  The 24 nations of the Organisation for
  Economic Cooperation and Development OECD hampered by
  sluggish industrial output and trade face slower economic
  growth and their joint balance of payments will swing into
  deficit in 1987 the Economist Intelligence Unit EIU  said
      The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD
  economic growth downwards to 25 pct this year compared with a
  28 pct growth forecast in December
      It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the
  smaller European countries it influences and Japan hardest
  hit by currency appreciation this year
      The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth
  rate forecasts for West Germany to 22 pct from 32 pct in
  December and to 23 pct from three pct for Japan
      It said it expected the OECD to post a current account
  deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988 due in
  large part to a 150 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices
      It said the US Current account deficit looked likely to
  fall even more slowly than forecast to 125 billion dlrs in
  1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986
      It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr
  payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year
      The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 1650
  dlrs a barrel by end1987 and 1550 dlrs in 1988 from about 18
  dlrs last year as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes
  increasingly ragged
      It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in
  foreign exchange markets and will lose a further 13 pct on its
  tradeweighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last
  years 184 pct drop The average markdollar rate is put at
  180 marks this year and 170 in 1988 while the yendollar rate
  is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an
  average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988 it said
      This is not a crash scenario but the dollars steeper
  angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball
  rather than a threepoint landing the EIU said
      Talking will not stop the dollars slide for long and the
  February meeting of finance ministers of the Group of Five and
  Canada produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to
  more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan or a tighter
  US Fsical policy it said
      It said the key to the dollars fortunes was the
  willingness of Japanese institutions to buy US Government
  assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss
      Thus far they have been willing the EIC said adding
  that if Japan was deterred from buying US bonds the dollar
  would collapse
      To contain such a currency crisis dollar interest rates
  would have to soar bringing recession and a Third World debt
  crisis it said
      On trade the EIU said prospects for 1987 look
  increasingly sick
      Import growth forecast in December at 45 pct is now seen
  slowing down to around 38 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to
  42 pct in 1988 it said
      The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest
  single factor with import growth there expected to feature a
  sluggish 35 pct growth in 1987 against the 65 pct forecast in
  December the EIU said
      On the export side it said it saw weak demand in West
  Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe while
  Japans exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by US
  Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower more
  competitivelypriced dollar
      It said in most of Europe and in Japan raw materials and
  oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986
