UK VISIBLE TRADE DEFICIT NARROWS IN FEBRUARY
  Britains visible trade deficit narrowed
  to a seasonally adjusted provisional 224 mln stg in February
  from 527 mln in January The Trade and Industry Department
  said
      The current account balance of payments in February showed
  a seasonally adjusted provisional surplus of 376 mln stg
  compared with a surplus of 73 mln in January
      Invisibles in February were put provisionally at a 600 mln
  surplus the same as in January
      Seasonally adjusted imports rose in February to 716
  billion stg from 673 billion in January Exports rose to a
  record 693 billion last month from 620 billion in January
      Trade Department officials said the improvement in
  Britains current account contrasted with most private
  forecasts and they attributed much of the strength to imports
  rising less quickly in February than might otherwise have been
  expected
      The Department said exceptionally cold weather in January
  reduced exports that month and that there had been an element
  of catching up in the February figures
      The seasonally adjusted volume index base 1980 a guide to
  underlying nonoil trade showed exports rising to 1310 from
  1146 in January and imports rising to 1422 from 1365
      The value of British oil exports in February rose to 751
  mln stg from 723 mln in Jnauary while oil imports rose to 425
  mln from 352 mln
      The Department said the upward trend in nonoil export
  volume continues and the underlying level of nonoil import
  volume seems to have stablised
      The Departnment said exports to the US May be benefiting
  from fluctuations in the mark and yen exchange rates
