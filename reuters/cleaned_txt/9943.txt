  enter the US government securities market to add reserves
  during its usual intervention period today economists said
      With federal funds trading at a steady 6316 pct most
  economists expect an indirect injection of temporary reserves
  via a mediumsized round of customer repurchase agreements
      However some economists said the Fed may arrange more
  aggressive system repurchase agreements
      Economists would also not rule out an outright bill pass
