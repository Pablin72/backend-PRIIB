ATTPHILIPS BID FOR CGCT OUTLINED
  American Telephone and Telegraph Co and
  Philips Telecommunications BV APT would hold 36 pct through
  direct and indirect holdings in Frances ltCie Generale de
  Constructions Telephoniques if a joint bid with French
  partners for the soontobeprivatised firm succeeds a
  director at one of the partner firms said
      Marc Mathieu of ltSociete Anonyme de Telecommunications
  SAT told journalists the bid foresaw a direct stake of 20 pct
  for APT the joint firm set up by the USs ATT ltTN and the
  NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken ltPGLOAS
      The other 80 pct would be owned by a holding company made
  up of SAT APT Cie du Midi ltMCDPPA and five mutual funds
     Under French law foreign investors are restricted to a 20
  pct direct stake in privatised companies but can boost their
  stake to 40 pct through indirect holdings
      The makeup of the holding company however is subject to
  close discussions within the government due to legal queries
  over the nationality of the mutual funds a Finance Ministry
  official said
      Although bought by French citizens they are managed by
  foreign banks ltMorgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York and
  ltBanque de Neuflize Schlumberger Mallet SA controlled by
  Algemene Bank Nederland NV ltABNNAS an SAT spokesman said
      CGCT which controls 16 pct of the French public telephone
  switching market is to be sold by the government for 500 mln
  francs by private tender
      Five groups are bidding for the company and the government
  has said it will choose CGCTs new owner by the end of April
      APT vicepresident Wim Huisman told a news conference a
  capital increase was envisaged if SATAPT wins CGCT but
  declined to give details or say how an increase would affect
  foreign stakes in CGCT
      In 1985 CGCT posted losses of 200 mln francs on sales of
  three billion after 1984 losses of 997 mln francs
      A joint SATAPT statement added that buyers were committed
  to investing 240 mln francs in CGCT research and production
  plants The APTSAT offer includes a provision for CGCT to
  produce APT 5ESSPRX switching technology and adapt it to
  French standards
      The tender was launched after a 1985 draft agreement for
  ATT to take over CGCT was abandoned following the introduction
  of the French government privatisation laws which reopened
  bidding among a wider range of applicants
      Other candidacies to take over CGCT include West Germanys
  Siemens AG ltSIEGF allied with Schneider SA ltSCHNPA
  subsidiary JeumontSchneider Swedens Telefon AB LM Ericsson
  ltERICST allied with Matra ltMATRPA and Bouygues SA
  ltBOUYPA Italys ltItaltel and Canadas Northern Telecom Ltd
  ltNTLTO
