MALAYSIA CUTS GAZETTED RUBBER PRICE
  Malaysia said it cut the gazetted
  price of rubber to 20278 cents per kg from 21312 cents in
  March effective immediately
      No export duty is applicable at this level against 38
  cent per kg last month because the government raised the
  export duty threshold price to 210 cents per kg in early 1985
      The cess for rubber research and replanting remained
  unchanged at 385 and 992 cents per kg respectively
