CHRYSLER ltC AMC BUYOUT VALUED AT 155 BILLION
  Chrysler Corps proposed acquisition of
  American Motors Corp is valued at about 155 billion dlrs
  including the cost of acquisition and the 767 mln dlrs in
  American Motor debt that Chrysler will assume analysts said
      They said Chryslers cost of acquisition was valued at  782
  mln dlrs paid in cash notes and Chrysler shares
      The analysts told Reuters that at a New York briefing
  Chrysler treasurer Fred Zuckerman outlined his companys
  agreement with Renault to assume AMCs debt as well as 332 mln
  dlrs in unfunded pension liabilities though the latter is not
  included valuing the transaction
      Analysts were generally positive on Chryslers proposed
  purchase of its muchsmaller rival but said they expected the
  transaction would carry with it a shortterm dilution in
  Chryslers earnings
      A Chrysler financial source speaking anonymously told
  Reuters that the proposed purchase price was smaller than it
  would have been had a deal been struck last year because the
  impact of the new US tax law removes Chryslers ability to
  assume AMCs large reserve of taxloss carryforwards
  accumulated from its losses since 1980
      There were very serious discussions last fall but we
  didnt pull it off the source said in a reference to the
  assassination in November of former Renault chairman Georges
  Besse
      Its too bad because the tax benefits fell on the floor
  And Renault could have gotten a much better price if wed done
  it before the end of last year
      In addition to AMCs debt and its pension liabilities the
  source said Chrysler would also assume any liability from
  lawsuits over the safety of Jeeps which he called an overhang
  to the company
      Analysts quoted Chrysler officials as having told them that
  the deal includes payment to Renault of 200 mln dlrs principal
  in the form of a 10year note at eight pct interest 35 mln
  dlrs cash for Renaults equity in AMCs finance subsidiary 25
  mln dlrs in cash for transaction fees in connection with the
  acquisition and 522 mln dlrs worth of Chrysler stock to be paid
  AMC shareholders
      The big number is the 767 mln dlrs in debt assumption
  analyst Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co told Reuters
       Moodys Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade 12
  billion dlrs of Chrysler Corp and unit debt due to the deal
       But the Chrysler source said that in assuming AMCs
  liabilities his company will refinance at a lower rate any AMC
  debt that is being carried at nonmarket rates
      He said there were difficulties in negotiating with the
  previous Renault management on the acquisition because they
  were committed to the groups business plan of which AMC was an
  integral part
      The new management didnt have that problem  AMC wasnt
  their baby he said
