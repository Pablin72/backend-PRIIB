ZIMBABWE GDP RISES 02 PCT IN 1986
  Zimbabwes real gross domestic product
  increased 02 pct in 1986 according to preliminary figures
  published by the Central Statistical Office CSO This
  contrasts with a rise of more than nine pct in 1985
      The main reason for the slower rate of economic growth was
  a drop in the real value of agricultural output This declined
  12 pct in 1986 following a 24 pct improvement the previous
  year Mining output fell one pct in 1986 but manufacturing
  production increased 14 pct
      The CSO said that at current prices GDP rose 127 pct to
  82 billion Zimbabwe dlrs but inflation measured by the GDP
  deflator was estimated at 122 pct so there was virtually no
  growth in real output during 1986
