US HOUSE PLAN SEEKS TO BAR FOREIGN TAKEOVERS
  A House subcommittee voted to give
  President Reagan authority to block foreign takeovers of US
  companies similar to the takeover of Schlumberger Ltds ltSLB
  Fairchild Semiconductor Corp by Fujitsu Ltd which was
  withdrawn
      The House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce
  approved as an amendment to the overall House trade bill a
  provision giving Reagan the power to block sales to foreign
  companies if the sale was not in the national or economic
  interest                
      The takeover provision was sent to the full Energy and
  Commerce Committee for consideration as part of the overall
  trade bill which is being written by several House committees
      The subcommittees bill would bar imports of digital audio
  recording equipment that is not made with anticopying chips
  This provision is designed to protect US companies from the
  unauthorized use of US designs in foreign products
      The bill calls for an investigation of whether US
  engineering and construction firms are given adequate
  opportunity to bid on Japans civil works procurement practices
  including the construction of the Kansai airport
      The Energy and Commerce subcommitte rejected a plan offered
  by Rep William Dannemeyer a California Republican to require
  the US to pay investors one pct for the right to hold their
  gold investments in government storage
      His amendment called for the government to sell gold coins
  and goldbacked bonds with maturities of 30 to 50 years to
  investors to reduce the federal debt
