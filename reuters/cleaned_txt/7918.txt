ALLIEDLYONS SEES SUBSTANTIAL SECOND HALF GROWTH
  ltAlliedLyons PLC will report
  substantial growth in the second half of fiscal 1987 ended
  March 7 chairman Derrick HoldenBrown said in answer to
  reporters queries
      You will certainly see substantial growth in AlliedLyons
  in the second half HoldenBrown said following a presentation
  to Toronto securities analysts
      HoldenBrown declined to say whether second half growth in
  profit before taxes would exceed the 207 pct rise reported in
  the first half AlliedLyons had first half profit of 1480 mln
  stg up from 1226 mln stg in the prior year
      AlliedLyons will also have a full year extraordinary cost
  of slightly more than seven mln stg for defence costs
  associated with Elders IXL Ltds failed takeover bid for the
  company HoldenBrown also said
      But that cost will be more than offset by an extraordinary
  gain of about 60 mln stg on AlliedLyons sale of its 249 pct
  interest in Australian brewers Castlemaine Toohey he said
      So with Australians you win some and you lose some But
  hopefully you win them all in the end HoldenBrown said
      Asked if he thought AlliedLyons is vulnerable to other
  takeover attempts HoldenBrown replied No I dont
      We must never be complacent and we must always be very
  watchful but I think we would be very expensive he said
      HoldenBrown said AlliedLyons share price to corporate
  earnings ratio is now comparable with other leading companies
  in the food and beverage industry
      That was not the case two years ago If the Australians had
  come a little bit earlier they might have had more luck I
  think HoldenBrown said
      HoldenBrown said AlliedLyons move to acquire Hiram
  WalkerGooderham and Worts Ltd in March 1986 during Elders
  takeover bid for the company was 100 pct a growth action
      We knew when we did it that it could be misconstrued and
  that people almost inevitably would say the acquisition was
  defensive but it never was HoldenBrown told reporters
      Asked by securities analysts if AlliedLyons plans a share
  issue in Canada after acquiring a 51 pct interest in Hiram
  Walker HoldenBrown responded Plan might be too strong a
  word But I must say I do feel the need for AlliedLyons to be
  better known in Canada
