TALKING POINTPUROLATOR COURIER CORP ltPCC
  Purolator Courier corps stock rose on
  specualtion that a disgruntled former Purolator director would
  find a new suitor for the company traders said
      Purolator agreed in late February to a 35 dlrashare 265
  mlndlr offer from EF Hutton LBO Inc and certain members of
  its Purolator courier divisions management
      The stock today hit 3614 up one
      Today Purolator revealed in a filing with the Securities
  and Exchange Commission that director Doresy Gardner resigned
  from its board of directors in a letter dated March 10
      The letter from Gardner said he resigned the board because
  the merger agreement with Hutton barred directors from
  soliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get a
  better deal Gardner said he believes a better offer might be
  found if the company would agree to be sold to some other
  entity or if it could sell off all or part of its US courier
  division
      Basically the courier division is a company that has
  450 mln dlrs in revenues Its a very large company and its
  being sold for 50 or 60 mln dlrs said Gardner in a telephone
  interview with Reuters
      Gardner is an official of Kelso Management a firm
  associated with Fidelity International Ltd A group of Fidelity
  companies owns eight pct of Purolator and Gardner said he
  personally owns 20000 shares
      A Purolator official said the company has no comment on the
  letter from Gardner
      Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service
  may emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator Before the
  transaction with Hutton LBO was announced analysts had also
  speculated another courier company would be the most likely
  suitor
      While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no
  new bidders he said the possibility one could appear pushed
  the stock into play again
      Theres no shortage of possibilities Its just a question
  of managements willingness to let the process continue said
  one arbitrager
      Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they
  believe Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction
  Hutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrs
  cash per share The balance of Purolators stock will be bought
  for securities and warrants in a new company holding the US
  courier operations
      The arbitragers said tender offer documents show that
  Hutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and
  will emerge with a giant majority equity interest in
  Purolator
      As far as I can tell from the public documents from the
  deal thats on the table Hutton is basically putting up zero
  One always likes a situation like that You always like to
  think if they can do this deal at no risk there should be
  someone else in the world that could do it higher said one
  arbitrager
      The firm however is supplying temporary financing and
  sources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the
  firm will not end up paying for its equity position
      While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document
  did note that the EF Hutton Group subsidiary may not have to
  keep cash in the transaction the sources said there is some
  risk to the firm
      There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash
  and all sorts of things that make it very speculative said
  one of the sources adding there are also severance payments to
  employees
      The EF Hutton Group subsidiary is supplying 279 mln dlrs
  in socalled bridge financing for the transaction The bridge
  financing is a temporary loan from Hutton
      The financing is to be replaced with permanent financing
  expected to come from banks However it may take some time to
  replace the financing the source said resulting in what could
  be a substantial expense to the firm
      Gardner said Hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mln
  dlrs from the transaction but sources close to the transaction
  said fees are at the low end of the scale
      Its a very complex transaction but basically what
  happens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recapture
  any investment they might have once the merger takes place
  Gardner said
