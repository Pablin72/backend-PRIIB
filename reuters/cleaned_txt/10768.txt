AMYLUM CHAIRMAN DISAPPOINTED BY FERRUZZICPC DEAL
  Belgian starch manufacturer ltAmylum NV
  is surprised and disappointed that its 675 mln dlr offer for
  the European business of CPC International Inc ltCPCN was
  apparently rejected in favour of a lower 630 mln dlr bid by
  Italys ltGruppo Ferruzzi chairman Pierre Callebaut said
      Callebaut told Reuters that Amylum a leading starch and
  isoglucose manufacturer in which Britains Tate and Lyle Plc
  ltTATLL holds a 333 pct stake had made an undisclosed
  initial takeover offer for CPCs European corn wet milling
  business by the close of CPCs tender on March 17
      The offer was raised on March 24 to a final 675 mln dlrs in
  cash after CPC told Amylum its initial bid was below Ferruzzis
  630 mln stg offer Callebaut said
      On the same day CPC announced it had agreed in principle
  to sell its European business to Ferruzzi in a 630 mln dlr
  deal
      Noting that Ferruzzi was studying a public offering of
  shares in its unit ltEuropean Sugar France to fund the CPC
  takeover Callebaut said Amylum may still succeed in its bid
      For the time being we just await developments But I note
  that whereas our higher offer was in cash Ferruzzi apparently
  is still organising finance Callebaut said
