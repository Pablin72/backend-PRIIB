SHORTTERM YEN INTEREST RATES SEEN FALLING SOON
  Japanese shortterm interest rates
  buoyed recently by seasonal factors are likely to fall from
  the beginning of April when the new financial year begins
  money traders said
      The Bank of Japan is expected to encourage the trend
  following its attempts to pressure rates to enhance its
  discount rate cut on February 23 they said
      The Bank cut the rate to 25 pct from three and began
  actively injecting funds into the money market to offset rate
  rises resulting from the endoffiscalyear surge in demand for
  funds from financial institutions
      Despite its attempts to dampen rates with measures such as
  aggressive commercial bill purchases the central bank has
  failed to remove all upward pressure money traders said
      Attractive interest rates offered by domestic banks to
  compete for time deposits of more than 600 mln yen has
  underpinned shortterm rates they said
      Interest rates on time deposits of more than 600 mln yen
  were decontrolled by the Finance Ministry last September
      This resulted in such deposits with domestic banks rising
  to 17830 billion yen by the endDecember a threefold
  increase on endDecember 1985 levels bankers said
      On March 31 the money market expects to see a 2000
  billion yen surplus resulting from government payment of fiscal
  funds money traders said

  fall to 35000 pct from 37500 pct today and the onemonth
  commercial bill discount rate to drop to 37500 pct from 40635
