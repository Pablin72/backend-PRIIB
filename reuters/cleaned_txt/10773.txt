PHILADELPHIA EXCHANGE TO EXTEND HOURS FOR ASIA
  The Philadelphia Stock Exchange PHLX
  a leading trader of currency options plans to extend its
  trading hours to serve Australasian and Far Eastern markets
  exchange president Nicholas Giordano said
      He told reporters the PHLX will open a new session between
  1900 and 2300 hours US EST from the beginning of the third
  quarter this year
      The PHLX is also opening an office in Hong Kong to serve
  clients in the region and educate financial markets about the
  advantages of currency options Giordano said
      Giordano was in Sydney to start an AsianPacific tour by
  exchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of the
  exchangetrade currency option market against existing
  overthecounter option trading during the local working day
      Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had become
  an accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk and
  had grown in popularity he said
      The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies including
  a new Australian dollar option and traded an average 42000
  contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30
  billion US Dlrs
      Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with the
  performance of its Australian dollar contract which since its
  introduction last year had regularly topped the French franc as
  the third most popular traded option with up to 8000
  contracts traded daily
      Having the Philadelphia exchange open during the
  AsiaPacific market day would open new hedging opportunities
  set a truer level for overthecounter option trading increase
  arbitraging opportunities and give corporations and treasuries
  access to a currency option market of much greater depth and
  liquidity with the security of a clearing house he said
