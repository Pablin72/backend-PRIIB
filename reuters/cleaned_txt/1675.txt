GATT COUNCIL DEFERS DECISION ON SEMICONDUCTORS
  The ruling GATT Council deferred a
  decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a
  European Community complaint against the US Japanese
  agreement on exports of computer semiconductors
      David Woods spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs
  and Trade GATT told a news briefing that the main parties
  would continue bilateral talks This was in the hope of
  resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15
      The fiveyear accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect
  the US Market from dumping of lowprice Japanese microchips
  officially known as semiconductors
      The EC Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by
  allowing Tokyo to monitor prices allowing it to set minimum
  prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries
      The 12nation Community also charged the agreement gave
  US Producers preferential access to the Japanese market
      Woods said many nations  Hong Kong Canada Switzerland
  Singapore Sweden Malaysia and Nigeria  had supported the EC
  complaint during the heated Council debate
      Japans delegate Minoru Endo and US Ambassador Michael
  Samuels replied in the debate that the EC Charges were
  unfounded but they were willing to continue bilateral talks
