JAPAN DENIES PLANS TO CUT DUTIES ON CHOCOLATE
  Agriculture Ministry officials said they
  are not considering cuts in import duties on chocolate to help
  ease friction with the United States over agricultural trade
      Japan has already lowered the duties sharply and we must
  consider domestic market conditions an official said
      Duties on chocolate were cut to 20 pct from 319 pct in
  April 1983
      Washington has been demanding a cut to seven pct
  equivalent to its own duties ministry sources said
      Japanese chocolate imports rose to 8285 tonnes in calendar
  1986 from 5908 in 1985 official statistics show
      However the ministry sources added it is possible the
  government may make further cuts in response to strong US And
  European demand
      Due to concern about the farm trade row with the US
  Toplevel government officials may press the ministry to cut
  the duties one said
      But he said it would be difficult for Japan to resolve its
  overall trade row with Washington and reduce its trade surplus
  which reached 586 billion dlrs in 1986
      Agricultural trade issues between Japan and the US
  Include Japanese import restrictions on 12 farm products
