UK MONEY RATES FIRM ON LAWSON STERLING TARGETS
  Interest rates on the London money market
  were slightly firmer on news UK Chancellor of the Exchequer
  Nigel Lawson had stated target rates for sterling against the
  dollar and mark dealers said
      They said this had come as a surprise and expected the
  targets 290 marks and 160 dlrs to be promptly tested in the
  foreign exchange markets Sterling opened 03 points lower in
  trade weighted terms at 713
      Dealers noted the chancellor said he would achieve his
  goals on sterling by a combination of intervention in currency
  markets and interest rates
      Operators feel the foreign exchanges are likely to test
  sterling on the downside and that this seems to make a fall in
  UK Base lending rates even less likely in the near term
  dealers said
      The feeling remains in the market however that
  fundamental factors have not really changed and that a rise in
  UK Interest rates is not very likely The market is expected
  to continue at around these levels reflecting the current 10
  pct base rate level for some time
      The key three months interbank rate was 116 point firmer
  at 10 978 pct
