LAENDERBANK EXPECTS MODEST PROFIT RISE IN 87
  Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG
  OLBVVI expects to maintain its dividend and to record a
  moderate rise in profits this year after the 1815 mln
  schilling net profit made in 1986 General Director Gerhard
  Wagner said
      Wagner told a news conference that last years 343 pct
  rise in net profit from 1351 mln in 1985 was largely due to
  greater domestic business and wider margins on schilling
  interest rates
      The bank Austrias third largest raised its 1986 dividend
  to 12 pct of its 15 billion schilling nominal share capital
  from 10 pct on capital of 135 billion in 1985
      Announcing the 1986 results Wagner said We will endeavour
  to maintain the higher dividend in 1987
      Laenderbanks balance sheet total rose five pct to 1977
  billion schillings against 81 pct growth in 1985 Foreign
  currency business last year accounted for some 37 pct of
  balance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985
      Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign business
  chiefly on the dollars fall against the schilling which is
  effectively pegged to the mark The dollars weakness had wiped
  some 89 billion schillings off the balance sheet total
      Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits from
  the banks London branch which opened in April 1985 but said
  that it came close to one mln stg
      On schilling lending profit on interest had risen 18 pct
  to 219 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed
  87 pct to 7389 mln
      According to the 1987 federal budget the state is due to
  lower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank probably to 51 pct
  Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state
