SAUDI BANKS FACE FURTHER LEAN PERIOD
  Saudi Arabias 11 commercial banks are
  reporting a further decline in profits for 1986 as increasing
  provisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non
  performing loans
      Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to build
  reserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline a
  little this year
      But the kingdoms still sluggish economy and legal problems
  hampering traditional lending operations mean earnings will
  remain vulnerable
      One senior bank credit officer said The work is largely
  done in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions
  but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money
      The sudden decline of Saudi Arabias corporate sector in
  1983  culminating in a number of debt reschedulings  has
  taken a heavy toll of bank profits with first results now
  appearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broad
  decline
      The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdoms banks had
  sunk to 8279 mln riyals from 266 billion in 1982 before world
  oil prices tumbled
      Of the kingdoms nine jointventure banks which operate on
  the Gregorian calendar year four have already reported and
  revealed a further profits decline  or net loss  for 1986 at
  the expense of increased provisions
      The newest and smallest of the joint ventures ltUnited Saudi
  Commercial Bank USCB reported a 1986 net loss of 159 mln
  riyals marginally less than 1985s shortfall of 170 mln
      Profits before provisions were sharply higher in part
  reflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year But the bank nearly
  trebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to
  60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985
      Other results released so far show ltSaudi American Bank
  SAMBA reporting a 538 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 807
  mln riyals while ltAl Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi known as Saudi
  French slid 14 pct to 949 mln riyals
      Both Saudi American owned 40 pct by Citicorps ltCCIN
  Citibank NA and Saudi French 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez
  increased provisions sharply
      ltArab National Banks net profit fell 178 pct to 1521
  mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 866 mln
  riyals
      Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non
  performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in the
  Saudi economy bottoms out
      Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic
  activity but one banker said The top 50 pct of the Saudi banks
  are now at or close to international levels on provisions
      From 1982 to 1985 the kingdoms largest bank ltNational
  Commercial Bank NCB stashed away 17 billion riyals in
  provisions or 89 pct of its total loans and advances to the
  private sector bankers calculated
      Between 1982 and 1985 ltRiyad Bank NCBs rival as the
  second biggest of the two allSaudi shareholding banks had
  covered 128 pct of its loans and advances Both banks operate
  on an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine
      Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency SAMA has been
  tightening supervision there is still no standardised rule for
  declaring loans as nonperforming
      Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures
  difficult because some banks still book nonaccruing interest
  as revenue while others follow more conservative practices in
  force in major world financial centres
      Bankers generally said NCB Riyad Bank and the
  jointventures SAMBA Saudi French and Arab National Bank rank
  as the strongest earners
      Other banks such as ltSaudi British Bank 40 pct owned by
  the ltBritish Bank of the Middle East are disadvantaged by a
  relatively low deposit base
      Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 91 mln
  riyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show another
  low figure But the bank has traditionally been one of the most
  conservative in making provisions
      Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see a
  Saudi bank go under and not only supported ltSaudi Cairo Bank
  after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also made
  available cheap deposits to ltSaudi Investment Bank and USCB
      The banks can onlend these to generate profit but
  generally banks are awash with liquidity since they are
  unwilling to risk incurring fresh nonperforming loans
      And while banks in more liberal financial markets can
  attempt to diversify away from traditional lending
  conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generate
  fee income from new investment banking products
      One banker said Operating earnings in the Kingdom are not
  good
      Reflecting the caution in new lending the amount of
  advances is showing a declining trend while the days when
  banks had ample funds in interestfree current accounts to
  invest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better return
  on their money
      In 1979 the ratio of interestbearing accounts to current
  accounts was 27 to 73 pct Today only about 40 pct of customer
  funds are held on current account
