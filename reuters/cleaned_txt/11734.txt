CURRENCY FUTURES CLIMB LIKELY TO BE CHECKED
  The surge in currency futures since
  Friday on the heels of the Reagan administrations proposed
  tariffs on Japanese imports is likely to be curtailed in the
  coming week financial analysts said
      The market is taking a breather now and I would expect it
  to last a little longer said Craig Sloane a currency analyst
  with Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co
      Profittaking which robbed the currency futures of some
  momentum today is likely to continue he said
      Central banks are likely to play a role in halting the
  advance in currencies through intervention the analysts said
  even though the dollar fell to a 40year low against the
  Japanese yen on Monday despite Bank of Japan intervention
      Treasury Secretary James Bakers comments that the G6
  nations remain committed to the Paris accord coupled with his
  refusal to give any targets for exchange rates provided a note
  of stability to the market Tuesday the analysts said
      Furthermore Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Horner
  said G6 central banks havent yet shown the full force of
  their commitment to the Paris accord
      Im among those who believe the G6 have a plan behind the
  scenes Horner said
      Horner said more forceful central bank intervention will
  firm the dollar and cap the rise in currency futures
      Coordinated punishing intervention by the central banks
   in contrast to the recent rolling intervention which has
  only smoothed out the market  is in the offing according to
  Horner
      I think were near the top of the range in the Europeans
  currencies he said
       On the other hand the upside target for the yen which
  set a new contract high today at 0006916 in the June contract
  is at 0007050 Horner said
      Still other analysts believe currency futures have yet to
  peak
      The basic trend in the currencies is higher said Anne
  Parker Mills currency analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers
  Inc The market wants to take the dollar lower
      Uncertainty over central bank action and nervousness over a
  G5 meeting next week in advance of a meeting of the
  International Monetary Fund could make for choppy price
  activity the remainder of the week Mills said
      In addition although the market shrugged off relatively
  healthy gains in February US leading economic indicators and
  factory orders Tuesday economic data could play a larger role
  in coming sessions the analysts said
      Fridays employment statistics in particular will be
  closely watched Sloane said adding that a forecast rise of
  250000 in nonfarm payroll jobs should underpin the dollar
