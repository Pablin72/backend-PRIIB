BAKER DENIES DOLLAR TARGET EXISTS
  US Treasury Secretary James Baker
  again said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris
  last month did not establish a target exchange rate for the
  dollar
      Baker said in a television interview aired here yesterday
  We dont have a target for the dollar He declined to comment
  on what might be a desired level for the dollar saying We
  really dont talk about the dollar
      He said protectionism was becoming extremely strong in the
  US In response to widening US Trade deficits and import
  barriers in other countries
      The mood in the United States is extremely disturbing Its
  extremely strong he said
      As Ive said before we sort of see ourselves as engaged
  here in a real struggle to preserve the worlds free trading
  system because if the largest market in the world the US
  goes protectionist we run the risk of moving down the same path
  that the world did in the late 1930s he said
      While relative exchange rates had a role to play in
  defusing the threat of protectionism it alone did not offer
  any solution he said
      You must address this problem on the exchange rate side
  but it cannot be solved on the exchange rate side alone Its
  far more comprehensive and broad than that and the solution of
  it requires a comprehensive approach Baker said in the
  interview
      Baker said it would be necessary for other countries to
  adjust their currencies upwards as well as remove their
  barriers to US Imports But he did not elaborate or name any
  countries
