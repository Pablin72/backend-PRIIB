US GRAIN TRADE CALLS SHULTZ REMARK SIGNIFICANT
  A statement yesterday by Secretary
  of State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers that
  US agricultural products must be competitively priced was
  significant in that he recognized the importance of the Soviet
  market and the need for US prices to be at world market
  levels US grain trade industry officials said
      They said that Shultzs comments while not explicitly
  endorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR were noteworthy
  because they were not negative towards such action
      In response to a query on what the State Departments
  position is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow Shultz told
  the leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that
  prices must be competitive if the US is going to trade
      The Soviet Union the worlds largest grain importer has
  bought no US wheat for more than a year complaining the
  price was far above world market levels A US offer last fall
  to sell the Soviets lowerpriced wheat through the export
  enhancement program EEP was also rebuffed due to the price
      Shultz was said to be adamantly against the US wheat
  offer last year and has been reported to be one of the major
  obstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet
  Union grain industry sources said
      Intense speculation the US might make a fresh EEP wheat
  offer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in
  recent trading sessions Kansas City hard wheat futures rose
  another 214 cents by midday at 28814 dlrs per bushel
  while CBT March wheat was up 112 cents at 29212 dlrs
      Im not sure this is an aboutface but its clearly a
  recognition that unless were competitive we wont sell to the
  Soviet Union said a lobbyst for a major commodity group
      We have to be competitive Its ridiculous to say that
  somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same
  thing at a lower price somewhere else Shultz told the farm
  leaders That is our approach in negotiations with the
  Soviets he said
      If those comments do signal that the State Department is no
  longer opposed to the US selling wheat to the USSR under EEP
  it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to
  Moscow an industry lobbyst said
      National Wheat Growers officials were taking a cautious
  attitude towards the secretarys comments
      His comments were not discouraging but they didnt in our
  judgment promise any immediate action on EEP an official with
  the wheat group said
      The Wheat Growers official noted however that there is
  significance in that fact that we havent seen any significant
  negative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets
      In a meeting with exporters this week Secretary of
  Agriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request
  that the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow the
  officials said
      An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz who is
  reported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets
  said that the Shultz comments are consistent with what he
  Shultz has taught for years as an economist but said they
  dont necessarily relate to the Soviet Union
      Amstutz could not be reached for comment and an aide to
  Lyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultzs statements
      But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may
  indicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow
      If he didnt say no then theres a chance This is
  potentially a positive development a commodity source said
