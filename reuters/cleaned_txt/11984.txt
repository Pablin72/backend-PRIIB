US ARGENTINA SETTLE SOYPRODUCT CASE  YEUTTER
  US Trade Representative Clayton
  Yeutter said the United States and Argentina have settled a 
  case brought by the US soybean crushing industry alleging
  unfair subsidies to Argentinas crushing industry
      Speaking to an Agribusiness Education forum here late
  yesterday Yeutter said the case was resolved at a meeting with
  Argentine Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figuerras during a
  trade ministers meeting in New Zealand last week
      Under a verbal understanding between the two ministers
  Argentina will soon abolish export taxes on soybeans and
  products US and Argentine officials said
      The US case brought by the US National Soybean
  Processors Association alleged Argentina through differential
  export taxes implicitly subsidized domestic soybean crushers
      The US crushing industry in its complaint under Section
  301 of trade law said higher Argentine export taxes on
  soybeans than on products encourage the export of products and
  represented an unfair trade practice
      Yeutter told Figuerras that all agencies of the US
  government supported the US complaint and unless Argentina
  took steps to eliminate the taxes the United States would
  consider taking further action in the case US and Argentine
  officials said
      An Argentine official here said no timetable was given for
  removal of the Argentine export taxes
