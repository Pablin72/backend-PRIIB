CONTL ILLINOIS SEES MONTHS OF BRAZIL DEBT TALKS
  Continental Illinois Corps ltCIL
  Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations to
  reschedule Brazils debt payments taking at least three to six
  months
      Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment of
  interest on its medium and longterm debts The moratorium is
  expected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talks
  are under way
      I believe it will take three to six months maybe longer
  for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazils
  debt Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing
      I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run Just
  how long the run is is anybodys guess Swearingen said
      Earlier the bank holding company said Brazils moritorium
  may force it to increase nonperforming loans by 380 mln dlrs
  and reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the first
  quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year
      The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize these
  loans as nonperforming William Ogden chairman of the
  Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago
  Continentals largest subsidiary said in response to an
  inquiry
      Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net
  income equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use
      Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for
  1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses
  Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducing
  office rental costs In 1986 it cut about 850 positions
      In 1986 it had net profits of 1652 mln dlrs or 60 cts a
  share up from 1505 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share
      The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poorquality loans and
  other assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp FDIC
  during 1986 It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the
  1984 restructuring agreement with the government
      The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that it
  is entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26 1987
  Swearingen said It will choose loans based on ultimate loss
  rather than their immediate effect on nonperforming loans
      In 1986 the banks loans to the Midwests middle market
  rose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the US
      Concerning banking acquisitions Swearingen said the bank
  would like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks In 1986 it
  bought three small suburban banks
      Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will be
  taken over because no bank in the Midwest region is large
  enough to buy it and New York money center banks are
  prohibited by law from buying Illinois banks
      He said however that the FDIC still has control over who
  will eventually own the firm because it still holds the
  equivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln
      The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and has
  said it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible The
  agency received the shares as part of its 45 billion dlrs 1984
  bailout of the bank
      Swearingen who came out of retirement in 1984 to head the
  struggling banking firm after a career as an oil industry
  executive said he will retire when the threeyear period he
  agreed to be Continental chairman ends in August He would not
  comment on a successor
      The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago options
  clearning unit into Tokyo Swearingen said but said its
  doubtful lending to Japan will occur because that country
  doesnt need external sources of cash
