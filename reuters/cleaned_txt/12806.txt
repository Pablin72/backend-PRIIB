US TREASURY POLICIES SAID UNCHANGED BY DEPARTURE
  The departure of James Bakers
  closest aide Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman will
  not change the course of Washingtons domestic and
  international economic policies US officials said
      Darman who has worked alongside Baker for six years was
  widely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives on
  currency management and international economic cooperation
      US Officials said Darman also played a key role in
  shepherding President Reagans sweeping tax reform plan through
  the US Congress
      But they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure
  to the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers
  signaled the Baker team was breaking up or that the Treasury
  Secretary himself might leave soon
      It really does not mean that he took the opportunity as it
  came up one official said
      Another commented Baker will miss him but hes not going
  to stand in his way
      There has been widespread speculation since last autumn
  that Darman sought a Wall Street job
      Officials said Darman felt the passage of tax reform late
  last year marked an appropriate moment to bow out
      Baker acknowledged Darman would be sorely missed
      Dick Darman has contributed mightily to the success of this
  administration over the past six years and his departure
  represents a substantial loss he said
      US Officials admitted Darmans absence would be an
  undoubted blow to Baker who has relied on him for policy
  advice both at the White House and in Reagans second term
  at the Treasury One aide once described Darman as
  indispensable to Baker
      Baker is widely thought to want a more stable currency
  system and Darman is generally credited by officials of other
  nations as Bakers leading theorist on this issue favouring
  target zones to limit currency fluctuations
      Earlier this year monetary sources said the US Treasury
  unsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system
      But a US Official disputed the assessment that with
  Darman gone Baker would abandon international initiatives
      Bakers work as head of Reagans Economic Policy Council
  spearheading trade policy and his skills in negotiating with
  the Democratcontrolled Congress will go on as before
      Darmans strength was not as an economist but as a
  political strategist and thats Bakers strength too the
  official said
      There were already indications that Baker who throughout
  his time in government has relied on a closelyknit circle of
  advisers has moved swiftly to find a successor
      One possibility is that Baker might turn to George Gould
  who holds the number three Treasury position of
  UnderSecretary
      Gould another close confidante has known Baker for years
      Before joining the Treasury in November 1985 Gould was a
  partner at the Wall Steet firm of Wertheim and Co and formerly
  headed Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp
      The Darman announcement came on the eve of the semiannual
  meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
  where many policies Darman helped shape will be debated
      He helped Baker devise the September 1985 Plaza Agreement
  when the United States Japan West Germany France and Britain
  curbed the dollars strength The pact was a major turning
  point in US Policy ending a period of disdain for economic
  cooperation and intervention in currency markets
      Darman also worked on some other Baker initiatives like
  the Tokyo Summit agreement to intensify coordination of
  economic policies among the leading industrial countries and
  the recent Paris Agreement to stabilise currencies and
  stimulate global growth
      These policies are collectively aimed at redressing the
  huge gap between Japan and West Germanys trade surpluses and
  the United States massive trade deficit
      That policy goal still remains a prime objective of the
  Reagan Administration and will not change with Darmans
  departure
