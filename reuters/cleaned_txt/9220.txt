EXCHANGE RATES ALMOST WITHIN G6 LEVELS  SUMITA
  Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita
  said that current exchange rates are almost within the levels
  agreed to by six major nations last month in Paris
      Asked whether a dollaryen rate of 148 or 149 reflected
  economic fundamentals he said current rates almost reflect
  fundamentals
      Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to
  bring about currency stability in line with the Paris
  agreement which stipulated that they would closely cooperate
  to that end He repeated the central bank will intervene if
  necessary adding he did not think a dollar freefall was
  likely
      But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currency
  levels would be considered in line with underlying economic
  fundamentals
      In Paris on February 22 Britain Canada France Japan
  the US And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold
  currencies around their then current levels
      Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behind
  the fall of the dollar to a record low against the yen
  yesterday But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as it
  nervously reacted to statements abroad and to developments
  surrounding trade tensions
      US Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend
  that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the
  dollar US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called
  USJapan relations on certain key trade issues very strained
      The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been
  moving narrowly against the yen since midJanuary Sumita said
  He added he does not expect the yendollar exchange rate to
  remain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharp
  rise of the yen
      The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange rates
  in line with the Paris accord he added
