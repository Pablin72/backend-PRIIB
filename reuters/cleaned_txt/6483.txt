BANK OF ENGLAND LENDS ONE BILLION STG AT 10 PCT
  The Bank of England said it had lent one
  billion stg to the discount market for fourteen days at 10 pct
      This brings the Banks total help today to some 134 billion
  stg and satisfies the estimated shortage in the system today
  which it had earlier estimated at 13 billion stg
      The Banks announcement this morning that it was willing to
  lend twoweek money at 10 pct was interpreted by the market as
  a sanction for lower UK Base lending rates
      The UK Clearing banks swiftly took this up cutting their
  base rates by a halfpoint to 10 pct At midday the central
  bank lowered its money market dealing rates by the same amount
