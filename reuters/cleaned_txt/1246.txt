  Peru coffee crop and producers are looking forward to a record
  harvest the president of one of Perus four coffee cooperative
  groups said
      Justo Marin Ludena president of the Cafe Peru group of
  cooperatives which accounts for about 20 pct of Perus exports

  was expected this year He said Peru exported 1616101
  quintales in the year to September 1986

  waters last month had not reached coffee plantations and the
  crop was unaffected

  Rica whose coffee cooperative exported 59960 quintales last
  year according to the statecontrolled coffee organisation
      Marin said the rains would only affect the coffee crop if
  they continued through to next month when harvesting starts

  year in the 13 pct export quota about 913000 quintales
  assigned to them by the International Coffee Organisation ICO
      He said Peru exported 1381009 quintales to ICO members
  last year with a value of around 230 mln dlrs and another
