IMF WORLD BANK TO MEET AMID NEW INFLATION FEARS
  Amid new concerns about inflation
  interest rate increases and trade confrontations
  finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discuss
  a deteriorating global debt and economic situation
      The meetings under the auspices of the International
  Monetary Fund and World Bank come as interest rates are
  turning higher and the alreadyweak dollar has sunk further
  upsetting bond and stock markets
      Uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the global
  economy and whether the heavilyindebted countries can continue
  to carry the burden of their growing debt without vast new
  assistance
      Monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signs
  any new debt initiative of the sort that Treasury Secretary
  James Baker unveiled 18 months ago in Seoul is in the works
      The strategy has drawn a serious challenge from Brazil
  which suspended interest payments on 67 billion dlrs of
  commercial bank debt last month The Banks have responded by
  laying the groundwork for writing down Brazilian loans
      Separately French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac in a
  visit earlier this week with President Reagan sounded out the
  administration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses to
  the very poorest states
      The French plan is certain to be discussed by the ministers
  in detail during next weeks meetings and will undoubtedly be
  embraced by the developing countries
      Theres interest on the part of some countries for looking
  at the support of the special problems of the very poorest
  countries because their position is so extreme a Reagan
  administration official said
      He suggested Washington was open to disussing the issue
      The meetings will also assess the success of the Baker debt
  initiative which called for new funding to help debtor
  countries grow out of their problems
      The largest industrial countries have been attempting to
  coordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling the
  decline of the dollar US trade and budget deficits and other
  problems
      At the same time the industrial countries see little
  evidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the Fund
  forecasts they will grow 25 pct
      The United States sees 32 pct growth for itself 
  continuing its expansion for a fifth year and has asked other
  industrial countries to stimulate their economies
      These issues directly affect the debt problem and the
  ability of the debtor countries to grow out of their
  difficulties
      In recent years US markets have absorbed the exports of
  developing country allowing them to earn critical foreign
  exchange But the United States wants to cut its trade deficit
  running at a record 1698 billion dlrs and is pressing others
  to import more from developing countries
      The discussions from April six to 10 will be
  wideranging touching everything from interest rates to the
  impact of development loans on the environment according to
  monetary sources
      The talks will include an examination of trade
  protectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the Reagan
  administration to place some 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on
  microchip products from Japan the sources said
      The move accelerated the dollars decline as financial
  markets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing
      There is concern that the action prompted by US charges
  that Japan has been selling computer chip products below fair
  market value and has kept its own market closed to imports
  further undermining the international trading system
      At the same time the ministers will discuss the
  fundamental price weakness in basic commodities the export
  mainstay of many developing countries
      The socalled Group of Five industrial countries  the
  United States Japan West Germany France and Britain  will
  gather for the first time since their February talks in Paris
  where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further
      The Five will be joined later by Italy and Canada for
  further debate on economic policy coordination
      As part of the Paris accord surplus countries such as
  Japan agreed to stimulate their economies while America
  said it would reduce its federal budget deficit
      Other major issues of the meetings include a US bid to to
  have a larger say in approving loans of the InterAmerican
  Development Bank strengthening the link between loans and
  economic policy changes in debtor nations
      Washington is also pressing the World Bank to take more
  account of the environment when making loan for dams and other
  projects
      The new head of the Bank Barber Conable has said this
  issue is being reviewed and will be part of a reorganization
  plan for the Bank now being prepared
