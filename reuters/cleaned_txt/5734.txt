NZ PORTS REOPEN BUT FURTHER CLOSURES POSSIBLE
  Harbour workers returned to work
  this morning after a strike in support of pay claims closed New
  Zealands 15 ports for 24 hours yesterday
      But the Harbour Workers Union told reporters the pay
  dispute is not settled and the unions national executive will
  meet here tomorrow to decide its next moves
      Obviously we will be considering further industrial action
  Union secretary Ross Wilson said in a radio interview
      The union rejects employers offers of a 75 pct pay rise
  over 15 months It wants 70 pct over 12 months
