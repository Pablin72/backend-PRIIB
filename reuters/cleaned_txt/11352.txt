SOVIET UNION SEEN WATCHING CHINA GATT APPLICATION
  Chinas application to join the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT is seen as a test case by
  the Soviet Union which will probably demand to follow China a
  top European Community official said
      Willy de Clercq External Relations Commissioner of the
  European Communities told a news conference that Chinas
  application would involve long and difficult negotiations
      China formally applied to join GATT in July 1986 and in
  February presented a memorandum backing its application which
  De Clercq said was now being studied Questions would then be
  presented to China
      After China other important statetrading countries
  including the Soviet Union will probably demand accession
  Chinas application could be considered a test case he said
      He said the EC strongly backed Chinas application but
  others among GATTs 92 contracting parties took a tougher line
      Among the numerous problems of a huge centrallyrun economy
  entering a free trade system are tariffs and reciprocity and
  the expectation that China will practice an opentrade policy
  without trade discrimination de Clercq added
      De Clercq noted the different dimensions of the Chinese
  economy and those of Hungary and Yugoslavia the two current
  Socialist GATT members
      On Chinas import potential he said a foreign exchange
  shortage would force China to import less this year and next
  than in the past with an emphasis on technological equipment
  and capital
      During his visit De Clercq has met top Chinese leaders and
  today signed an agreement to open a European Community
  Commission office in Peking
