  EF Hutton LBO Inc is still interested
  in an acquisition of Purolator Courier Corp and is examining
  the possibility of raising its 35 dlr per share offer an EF
  Hutton spokesman said
      Huttons offer was topped by a 40 dlr per share offer from
  Emery Air Freight Corp ltEAF earlier this week
      Were definately not out of it at this point the Hutton
  spokesman said
      We want to see what the offer is completely and understand
  it fully and then fashion our response the spokesman said
      After Emery made its offer Hutton extended the deadline on
  its offer to Monday The offer was to have expired Wednesday
      Analysts said it might be difficult for Hutton to raise the
  offer since Emery an overnight courier might have an easier
  time justifying a lofty price since it would realize cost
  savings by combining its business with those of Purolator
      Purolator a New Jerseybased overnight courier has
  declined comment
      Purolator had traded above the Hutton offer price on
  speculation a new bidder would emerge It was up 18 today at
  4038 above the Emery offer
