IBM ltIBM REBOUND SEEN BY BERNSTEIN ANALYST
  International Business Machines Corp
  hit by a twoyear earnings slump should begin a comeback by
  the end of 1987 and post strong growth in 1988 analyst Rick
  Martin of Sanford C Bernstein Co Inc said
      There will be increasing momentum in earnings albeit not
  until later this year Martin said at a technology conference
  sponsored by the investment firm
      Martin said the coming rebound reflects new product
  introductions in the midrange area rather than any drastic
  improvement in economic growth or US capital spending
      IBM whose stock hit a 52week low of 11534 dlrs in
  midJanuary has come back lately IBM was trading up 78 at
  14912 dlrs
      Analysts computer industry executives and the company
  itself have highlighted the external economic factors
  hampering IBMs growth
      But Martin said the product cycle was key to understanding
  the rise and fall of IBM and other computer companies and
  pointed to Digital Equipment Corp ltDEC to support his view
  By replacing the product line earnings have soared he said
  of DECs line of VAX computers
      In contrast to DEC IBM faultered with an incompatible
  midrange product line A new computer codenamed Fort Knox
  was supposed to tie together a number of IBMs midrange
  systems but the product never got off the ground he said
      Instead aspects of the computer were integrated into the
  IBM 9370 machine introduced last year and other aspects should
  be unwrapped by 1988 Martin said The major story will be a
  rebound in its midrange business
      He said sales of IBMs midrange computers fell about 13
  pct in 1986 But the new products will lead to 58 pct growth
  in midrange computers this year and 307 pct growth in 1988
      Highend computers primarily the Sierra line are coming
  to the end of their product life cycle Although growing 225
  pct in the midst of IBMs sharply lower 1986 year growth will
  drop to 15 pct in 1987 and 19 pct in 1988 he said
      By 1988 overall revenue growth should rise to about 16
  pct against 58 pct growth in 1987 and 24 pct in 1986 Martin
  said Last year IBM earned 48 billion dlrs on revenues of
  513 billion dlrs
      Investors asked what this all meant to DEC whose earnings
  and stock have been propelled by a strong slew of product
  introductions in the midrange area
      In response Martin said he did not view IBM as a threat to
  DEC nor DEC as a threat to IBM because both companies were
  catering largely to existing customer bases rather than
  stealing market share from one another
