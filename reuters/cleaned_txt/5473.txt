ROYAL TRUST PLOTS AGGRESSIVE GLOBAL EXPANSION
  ltRoyal Trustco Ltd in a move unique
  among Canadian trust companies is pursuing a bold global
  expansion that could someday lift the foreign share of its
  yearly earnings to 50 pct president Michael Cornelissen said
      First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analyst
  Michael Walsh said Royal Trusts international growth target is
  attainable But it will be a tremendous achievement because
   theyre going to have to build an international earnings
  base larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic
  trust companies Walsh said
      Global operations which made up 22 pct of Royal Trusts
  154 mln dlr 1986 net profit will post 33 pct profit growth
  this year against an expected 15 pct jump in total company
  profit Cornelissen told Reuters in an interview
      He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26
  pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990
      Royal Trust Canadas second largest trust company with
  assets of about 1954 billion Canadian dlrs has operated
  internationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank
      Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s when
  other Canadian trusts the equivalent of US savings and
  loans were focusing on domestic retail banking
      The companys overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened
  domestic competition and impressive growth at its London bank
  operations which attained full British banking powers in 1980
  Cornelissen said
      Last year Royal Trust moved into continental Europe and
  Asia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow Chemical
  Co ltDOWs Dow Financial Services Corp which included asset
  management merchant and private banking companies
      It was a heavensent opportunity Cornelissen said of the
  Dow Financial acquisition We achieved in one year what would
  otherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up
      Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun direct
  competition with major global financial institutions in
  activities such as international lending and stock brokerage
  in order to exploit profitable niches overseas in traditional
  trust activities such as asset management private banking and
  advisory services
      He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations
  before the end of this month to sell its Londonbased Savory
  Milln brokerage acquired in the Dow Financial deal
      The international market is so big and we have such a
  miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really
  limited only by our energy and our desire to find more
  business he said adding that in trusttype services we
  dont think the international markets are wellserved
      Aiding Royal Trusts foreign growth are greater foreign 
  investment interest in North America and increased Canadian
  investment abroad Cornelissen said
      Central to Royal Trusts strategy is Asia boasting rapid
  economic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital said
  Cornelissen whose company administers assets of 7185 billion
  dlrs more than any other Canadian trust
      Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000 Asia
  will contain twothirds of the worlds population and 50 pct of
  global productive capacity Cornelissen said We knew we had
  to be there Royal Trusts 14 international locations include
  offices in Tokyo Hong Kong and Singapore The company also
  recently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
      The Royal Trust president said the company was stressing
  growth within its overseas units adding he did not foresee any
  acquisitions in the immediate future although we have our
  eyes wide open for the right opportunities
      Asked about Royal Trusts plans for the US which the
  company abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units
  Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well
  covered by hundreds of small regional banks
      That doesnt mean to say we shouldnt be in the US
  said Cornelissen That is probably one area that we will
  probably do something with in the next five years
      He said the company would continue to emphasize its home
  Canadian market which Cornelissen and financial services
  analysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust
      Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks
  trusts insurance and securities dealers full participation in
  one anothers actitivies will mean more domestic competition
  for Royal Trust but not drastically more Cornelissen said
