  announced before the opening today expires March 25

  announcement She said a statement was expected but it was not
  certain when it would be ready 
      She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact

      I think they will resist it said Elliott Schlang
  analyst at Prescott Ball and Turben Inc Any company that

  offers for any and all shares for cash Schlang said ChemLawn
  could try to find a white knight if does not want to be
  acquired by Waste Management
      Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said
  ServiceMaster Companies LP ltSVM or Rollins Inc ltROL were
  examples of companies that could be interested
      ChemLawn with about two mln customers is the largest US
  company involved in application of fertilizers pesticides and
  herbicides on lawns Waste Management is involved in removal of
  wastes

  fourth quarter In 1986 ChemLawn earned 119 dlrs per share for
  the full year and 258 dlrs in the fourth quarter
