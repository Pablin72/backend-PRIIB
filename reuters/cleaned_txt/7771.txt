 EC SAYS US BROKE TRADE RULES IN AKZODUPONT ROW
  The European Community Commission has
  charged the United States with breaking international trade
  rules by excluding Dutchmade fibres from the US Market and
  said it would take the issue to the world trade body GATT
      In the latest of a series of trade disputes with
  Washington the executive authority alleged that a section of
  the US Tariff Act was incompatible with the GATT General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade because it discriminated
  against imported products in favour of domesticallyproduced
  goods
      The Commission said it would ask Genevabased GATT to rule
  on whether the section in question which officials said had
  proved a barrier to many EC exporters conformed to its rules
      Commission officials did not rule out retaliatory measures
  if after a GATT decision against it Washington failed to
  bring the disputed section into line with international rules
      The executives decision to go to GATT follows a complaint
  to it by the Dutch company Akzo ltAKZOAS whose aramid
  synthetic fibres have been banned from the US Market because
  of charges by the US Firm ltDupont that the fibres violate
  the American companys patents
      Akzo alleged that the ban imposed by the US
  International Trade Commission ITC was discriminatory and
  incompatible with GATT provisions
      The dispute centres on the fact that section 337 of the
  US Tariff Act gives the ITC jurisdiction  over imported
  products The EC Commission charged that EC producers did not
  have the same possibilities for defending themselves before the
  ITC as they would have in a normal US Court
      Consequently the procedure followedIs less favourable
  than that which takes places in normal courts of law for goods
  produced in the United States it said in a statement
