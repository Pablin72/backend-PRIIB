TRADE FRICTION THREATENS TO TOPPLE NAKASONE
  Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone may have
  been dealt a fatal political blow by the yens renewed rapid
  rise and the threat of a trade war with the United States
  political analysts said
      Nakasone already under fire over an unpopular tax reform
  plan may now be forced to resign before the June economic
  summit of seven industrialised nations if local elections later
  next month go against candidates from his ruling Liberal
  Democratic Party LDP they said
      The close relationship between Nakasone and President
  Reagan was an important element of Nakasones power base
  Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchida
  told Reuters So the emergence of US Criticism damages
  Nakasone
      Even before the latest trade friction flared Nakasone was
  encountering criticism not only from opposition parties but
  also within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax
      Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves from
  Nakasone Uchida said His position within the LDP itself is
  not so strongly established today
      Nakasone who has been more popular with the general public
  than with many LDP members is now seeing his public support
  eroded the analysts said
      The yens rise to record highs and the US Threat on
  Friday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods in
  retaliation for Japans alleged violation of a microchip trade
  pact are now giving Nakasones critics fresh ammunition the
  analysts said
      Apparently the special relationship between Reagan and
  Nakasone hasnt worked effectively Rei Shiratori director of
  the Institute for Political Studies in Japan said
      This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasones
  credibility Shiratori told Reuters
      The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue the yens
  rise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP losses
  in the April 11 and 26 local elections analysts said
      If the elections go against the LDP Nakasone may have to
  resign early Shiratori said
      But Nakasone still has a chance to soothe US Tempers
  before or during his weeklong Washington visit from April 29
  some analysts said
      However unless the Japanese political system can move more
  quickly to give Nakasone some nice present to take to
  Washington on smouldering trade issues he will face a very
  hostile audience said Merrill Lynch Securities economist
  William Sterling
      If the trip is a major disaster it would seem to put the
  final nail in his coffin he said
      Reagans own weakened domestic position and growing
  Republican as well as Democratic anger with Japan argue
  against a quick settlement to the trade dispute the analysts
  said
      But a desire on both sides to find some solution coupled
  with uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors to
  Nakasone could still lead to an attempt to paper over the
  differences and aid Nakasone they said
      One factor against a trade war may be that Washington is
  not anxious to push Nakasone into his grave Sterling said
