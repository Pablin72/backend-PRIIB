EC COLD AID FOOD SCHEME MAY BE MADE PERMANENT
  Emergency action to distribute
  European Community EC food surpluses to the poor has proved
  so successful that the EC executive Commission may propose a
  permanent scheme a Commission spokesman said
      Almost 60000 tonnes of food was taken out of EC stores
  between January 20 when Agriculture Ministers approved the
  scheme and March 13 according to latest commission figures
      The food including 30000 tonnes of cereals 6000 tonnes
  of sugar 4000 tonnes of beef and 13300 tonnes of butter has
  been distributed to the needy through charities
      The present scheme was approved as an emergency measure to
  help poor people affected by this years unusually cold winter
  and will end on March 31
      But the spokesman said the commission will consider whether
  to propose it be replaced by an allyearround system
      The commission estimates that up to March 13 the temporary
  scheme cost between 63 and 68 mln European currency units
  7278 mln dlrs This is above the 50 mln Ecu 57 mln dlr
  ceiling originally envisaged by the Ministers
      However commission sources said the real cost was small if
  account is taken of the expense of keeping food in store until
  its quality and value deteriorates
      On the other hand the impact of the temporary scheme on EC
  food surpluses has been slight EC surplus food stocks at
  January 31 included 128 mln tonnes of butter 520000 tonnes
  of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals
