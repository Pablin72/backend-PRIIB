SOUTH KOREA TO PAY MORE FOR JAPANESE ETHYLENE
  South Korea will pay about 20 pct more for
  ethylene imported from Japan in the second quarter of the year
  because increased plastic production in both countries has
  boosted demand and tightened supplies chemical industry
  sources said
      South Korea has agreed to pay Japanese trading houses just
  over 400 dlrs C and F per tonne up from an average of 350 dlrs
  in the first quarter and throughout 1986 they said
      South Korean demand for imported ethylene this month has
  risen to 17000 tonnes from 10000 last month and the country
  may face difficulties covering the extra volume they said
      ltKorea Petrochemical Industries Corp a producer of high
  density polyethylene HDPE and polypropylene will more than
  double its ethylene requirements to 9000 tonnes a month from
  4000 when it completes a plant expansion at the end of this
  month the sources said
      ltHonan Ethylene Corps import requirements have risen to
  8000 tonnes a month from 6000 tonnes last year to meet strong
  demand from ltHonan Petrochemical Co which makes HDPE and
  ethylene glycol and ltHangyang Chemical which produces
  lowdensity polyethylene and vinyl chloride monomer they said
      But Japans ethylene plants are already operating at almost
  full capacity of 45 mln tonnes a year just to fulfill domestic
  demand the sources said
      And even if Japan had the additional ethylene there is a
  logistical problem of finding extra appropriatesized vessels
  to ship it to Korea said one trading house source
      Japanese trading companies are looking to alternative
  sources to supply South Koreas needs including Saudi Arabia
  Qatar and Mexico they said
      But longhaul voyages are expensive as the product has to
  be shipped at a temperature of minus 103 degrees centigrade to
  keep it in a liquid form they said
      Japan has no plans to invest further in the ethylene
  industry in order to cope with the additional demand despite
  rising prices trading house sources said
      South Korea has two projects in hand which will increase
  its ethylene production capacity by 500000 tonnes a year by
  the end of 1989 so the strong demand surge for imports is only
  a mediumterm trend they said
