LYNG TO MEET WITH EXPORTERS EEP LIKELY TOPIC
  Secretary of Agriculture Richard
  Lyng will meet with representatives from major grain exporting
  companies today and the subject of subsidized wheat to the
  Soviet Union will likely be discussed an aide to Lyng said
      Todays meeting set to begin at 1500 EST 2000 gmt was
  scheduled at the request of the exporters the aide said
      The EEP export enhancement program is pretty obviously
  one of the things they the exporters want to talk about but
  they havent any agenda as far as I know Lyngs aide said
      Private industry export officials have met periodically
  with Lyng to discuss farm policies and the export situation
  Whether this meeting will prompt any US action on the issue
  of whether Moscow will be offered export bonus wheat is
  uncertain the aide said
      I dont know what theyll tell us that we dont already
  knwo but well hear what they have to say Lyngs aide said
      The USDA official said that as far as he knows there has
  been no further action on offering the Soviet Union wheat under
  the EEP
