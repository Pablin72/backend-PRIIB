ATT ltT CHAIRMAN SAYS DIVIDEND WILL NOT BE CUT
  American Telephone and Telegraph Co does
  not plan to reduce its regular quarterly dividend of 30 cts a
  share on its common stock said James E Olson chairman
      It has been the intent to set the dividend at a level so
  that it could be sustained through the ups and downs of the
  business cycle Olson told a meeting of securities analysts
      We see no reason to change that policy he said
      Although ATT will maintain its current dividend Olson said
  the company wants to decrease the percentage of earnings paid
  in dividends by increasing earnings
      Industry analysts had speculated that ATT might cut its
  common dividend especially after the company posted a fourth
  quarter net loss of 117 billion dlrs and earned only five cts
  a share for the full year
      The loss included a onetime restructuring charge of 17
  billion dlrs
      Olson said he expects ATTs cash flow to remain strong
  despite the poor earnings
