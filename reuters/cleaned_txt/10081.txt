FEDS HELLER SAYS DOLLARS LEVEL IS APPROPRIATE
  Federal Reserve Board governor Robert
  Heller said that the dollars current level is appropriate but
  declined to comment on widespread market reports of concerted
  central bank intervention this week
      The dollar is stable again The current level is the
  appropriate level Heller told reporters after a speech to a
  meeting of financial services analysts
      He said last months sixnation currency accord in Paris
  did not include target ranges for the dollar in an academic
  way
      Heller also said that it was too early to determine whether
  the parties to the sixnation accord were taking appropriate
  steps to carry out the longerterm economic adjustments agreed
  to in Paris
      Clearly theyve not been implemented yet No one
  expects implementation within a week or two he said
      Earlier today US Treasury assistant secretary told a
  Senate banking subcommittee that he did not believe that West
  Germany and Japan have yet carried out their international
  responsibilities
