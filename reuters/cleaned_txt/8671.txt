JAPAN ECONOMY MAY START BOTTOMING OUT SOON AGENCY
  Japans economy remains sluggish but is
  beginning to show signs it may bottom out soon the Economic
  Planning Agency said in a monthly report submitted to Cabinet
  ministers
      But a bottoming out of the economy depends largely on the
  yens exchange rate trend in the immediate future Agency
  officials said
      The officials told reporters industrial production down
  05 pct in January from December is likely to turn positive in
  February and to rise thereafter raising hopes for a brighter
  economic outlook
      The Agency predicted industrial production will grow 25
  pct in the current JanuaryMarch quarter after falling 07 pct
  in the previous quarter
      A rise of this size would be the largest since the fourth
  quarter of 1984 when industrial output rose 27 pct the
  officials said
      They also said an expected upturn in exports would be a
  mixed blessing as it would contribute to economic growth but
  would increase the chance of trade friction
      Japanese exports contracted five pct in February from
  January but are likely to grow from March if the yen stabilizes
  around current levels the officials said
      They predicted exports will increase by 23 pct in the
  JanuaryMarch quarter from the OctoberDecember quarter
      But the problem is imports are not expanding said one
  official Imports fell by 94 pct in February from January
