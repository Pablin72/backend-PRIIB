BP TO OFFER 74 BILLION DLRS FOR STANDARD SHARES
  British Petroleum Co Plc ltBPL said it
  intended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil
  Co ltSRDN it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash for
  a total of 74 billion if the offer is fully accepted
      The offer would be made through its ltBP North America Inc
  unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1 The
  offer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares
  being tendered
      BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was based
  on its own valuation as well as those of its financial
  advisers It took into account reviews of both public and
  nonpublic information
      Standard closed in New York last night at 6478 dlrs down
  134 dlrs
      BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p at
  last nights close
      About a third of the cash payable would be met from BPs
  own resources
      The remainder would come from new borrowings partly from
  banks under a fouryear committed revolving credit facility and
  partly from a a new US Dlr commercial paper programme The
  company said it was in the course of arranging these
  facilities
      BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the groups
  investment in Standard was its largest single asset Full
  ownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be
  made without the limitations of a minority interest
      BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimum
  use of its financial resources It was confident oil prices
  were likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the
  investment
      Walters added that it also felt that due to management
  changes in 1986 Standard could now operate successfully even
  in a lower oil price environment
      Standards net assets at end1986 were 702 billion dlrs
  and in the year it reported a loss of 108 billion dlrs before
  tax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs
      Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise
  One noted that it was not immediately clear why the group
  should spend so much money buying a company it already
  controlled
      BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standard
  shares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago
      It was also unclear what effect the tender would have on
  the UK Governments recent announcement that it intended to
  dispose of its remaining 317 pct stake in BP sometime in the
  198788 financial year analysts said
      Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson noted
  that any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP would
  depend on the reaction of the markets
      The deal would probably push BPs gearing up to around 59
  pct from 20 pct currently he said
      However with the likelihood that oil prices would not
  repeat last years rapid drop the prospects for Standard
  returning to profitability this year  and BP benefitting from
  its cash flow  were good
      Standard was a high cost oil producer the analysts noted
      Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to
  make money and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from
  production and its downstream activities would push it
  comfortably into surplus
      BP initially took a stake in Standard following the
  discovery of oil in Alaskas Prudhoe bay in 1969 BP had
  inadequate distribution facilities in the US While Standard
  which was strong on marketing and refining was short on crude
  oil
      The analysts said that BP had promoted a major management
  reorganisation of Standard in the past year
      The probability that much of the shakeup at Standard was
  now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the
  tender offer Spedding said
      BPs willingness to take hard decisions such as major
  balance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well
  received in the markets
      The lower costs that should now be possible  especially
  after the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division
   should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come
  straight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by
  other sectors
