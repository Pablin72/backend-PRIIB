MANUFACTURERS ltMHC PUTS BRAZIL ON NONACCRUAL
  Manufacturers Hanover Corp said it
  placed 14 billion dlrs of medium and longterm loans to
  Brazilian borrowers on nonaccrual as of yesterday meaning
  that income will be recorded only when actual cash payments are
  received
      As a result net income for the first quarter will be
  reduced by 18 mln dlrs
      If Brazil which suspended interest payments on its term
  debt on February 20 continues to defer interest payments for
  the rest of the year net income for the whole of 1987 would be
  reduced by a total of 72 mln dlrs
      US bank accounting guidelines do not require loans to be
  placed on nonaccrual unless interest payments are past due 90
  days or more  However Manufacturers Hanover said that in
  light of current circumstances it was more appropriate to
  record income on its Brazilian loans only when cash payments
  were received
      It added that it believes Brazil will reach agreement with
  its banks on a debt restructuring and that all interest
  payments will be received later in 1987
      The company earned 1021 mln dlrs in firstquarter 1986 and
  4107 mln dlrs for the whole of the year
