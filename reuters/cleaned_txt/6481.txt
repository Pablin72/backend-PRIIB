VWS AUDI SAYS PROFIT FELL AROUND 50 PCT IN 1986
  Audi AG ltNSUGF the 99 pct owned
  subsidiary of Volkswagen AG ltVOWGF said profit in 1986 fell
  by around half compared with 1985 when it achieved a record
  221 mln marks net profit a rise of 195 pct on the previous
  year
      Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a news
  conference he expected both profit and turnover to rise this
  year compared with 1986 but he said it was questionable
  whether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels
      He gave no figure for 1986 profit Audi had predicted last
  year that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified
  amount from 1985s record levels
      Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 99 billion marks from
  96 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10
  billion this year
      Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the
  parent company overcome its currency losses Habbel said Audi
  would ensure VW got a share of profits
      Audis entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free
  reserves to help finance investment In the previous 10 years
  VW had received 80 pct of Audis earnings as a dividend
      Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output
  caused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model on
  currency factors and on negative publicity in the US About
  alleged sudden acceleration of some of its Audi 5000 models
      As reported Audis sales in the US Dropped nearly 20 pct
  to 59800 last year
      Habbel said the US Sales decline would probably bottom
  out in 1987
      Audis worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363000
      Of the total exports fell 105 pct to a rounded 210000
  but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154000 from 137180
  in 1985
      Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the
  first two months of 1987 helping Audi to increase its overall
  market share in West Germany to 84 pct from 52 pct in the
  same months of 1986 Sales in Europe also rose but US Sales
  fell further he said without giving details Worldwide
  deliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to
  57000
      Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to
  over 400000 from 384000 in 1986 when output had fallen
  compared with 1985s 392000
      Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead to
  further new hiring of employees
      At the end of 1986 Audis workforce stood at a record
  39800 a rise of 3400 over 1985
