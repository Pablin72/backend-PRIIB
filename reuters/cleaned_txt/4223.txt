  K Mart Corp said its record fiscal
  1986 net earnings of 5823 mln dlrs a rise from 2212 mln dlrs
  a year ago marked a major turning point for the worlds
  second biggest retailer
      K Mart said the earnings rise for the fourth quarter ended
  January 28 to 285 mln dlrs from 105 mln dlrs resulted from 
  merchandising refurbishing and expense control

  discontinued operations Earnings from continuing retail
  operations in the quarter totalled 270 mln dlrs or 200 dlrs a
  share compared with 2494 mln dlrs or 191 dlrs a year ago
      K Mart Chairman Bernard Fauber said the success of these
  programs is better illustrated by the strong 359 pct increase
  in 1986 income from continuing operations before income taxes
  to 103 billion dlrs the first time K Mart Corp has reached
  this milestone
      Sales for the 1986 fiscal year reached a record 238
  billion dlrs an 81 pct rise from 2204 billion dlrs the prior
  year K Mart said 1985 was restated to account for discontinued
  operations Comparable store sales rose 55 pct in 1986 over
  1985 it said
      Fauber said the sales growth came from greater consumer
  acceptance of K Marts apparel merchandise a marked increase
  in hardline merchandise sales and a growing contribution from
  specialty retailing operations
      K Mart said its fourth quarter pretax income from
  continuing operations was 493 mln dlrs a 323 pct gain from
  3726 mln dlrs last year It said sales in the period grew 88
  pct to 723 billion dlrs from a restated 665 billion dlrs in
  1985 with comparable store sales up 47 pct

  from 376 pct in 1985 But it said selling general and
  administrative expense eased to 232 pct of sales from 237 pct
  in 1985
      Our performance in 1986 marks a major turning point for K
  Mart Fauber said in a statement
      In the years immediately prior to 1986 we focused on
  changing the look of our stores and the structure of the
  company
      K Mart he said committed billion of dollars for store
  remodeling and installing a centralized point of sale system
  upgraded its merchandise mix acquired three large specialty
  retailers divested underperforming businesses and restructured
  its longterm debt
      We were forced to pay a temporary price in the form of
  slower earnings growth and a lower rating by the investment
  community However beginning with the fourth quarter of 1985
  our improved performance is proof that our approach is correct
  for the long term the K Mart chairman said
