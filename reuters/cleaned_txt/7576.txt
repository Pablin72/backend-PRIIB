STANDARD BANK UNABLE TO MAKE EARNINGS FORECAST
  Standard Bank Investment Corp Ltd
  SPRJJ chairman Henri de Villiers said he could not predict
  profits for the bank this year because of South Africas
  continuing political unrest
      De Villiers also warned in the annual report that failing
  prompt and decisive political action South Africa faces a
  future of violent deadlock between different racial and
  political groupings 
      He said South Africas future economic prospects are
  clouded by political and social issues and in the absence of
  evidence that these are being positively addressed I am unable
  to offer an earnings forecast for 1987
