SAUDI RIYAL DEPOSIT RATES REMAIN FIRM
  Saudi riyal interbank deposits were
  steady at yesterdays higher levels in a quiet market
      Traders said they were reluctant to take out new positions
  amidst uncertainty over whether OPEC will succeed in halting
  the current decline in oil prices
      Oil industry sources said yesterday several Gulf Arab
  producers had had difficulty selling oil at official OPEC
  prices but Kuwait has said there are no plans for an emergency
  meeting of the 13member organisation
      A traditional Sunday lull in trading due to the European
  weekend also contributed to the lack of market activity
      Spotnext and oneweek rates were put at 614 534 pct
  after quotes ranging between seven six yesterday
      One three and sixmonth deposits were quoted unchanged at
  658 38 718 678 and 738 18 pct respectively
      The spot riyal was quietly firmer at 3749598 to the
  dollar after quotes of 3750003 yesterday
