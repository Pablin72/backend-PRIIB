US OFFICIAL TO VISIT JAPAN AS TRADE ROW GROWS
  Undersecretary of State Michael
  Armacost will visit Tokyo next week for meetings with
  highlevel officials that will include talks on the growing
  trade row over Japanese semiconductor electronics products
      He is the first highlevel US official to visit Japan
  since President Reagan announced last week plans to impose
  tariffs worth up to 30 mln dlrs on Japanese electronic goods on
  April 17 in retaliation for Tokyos alleged failure to live up
  to a pact on microchip trade signed last September
      Deputy State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the
  trip is set for April 6 to 8
      USJapanese talks of this kind are regularly held each
  year at this time she told reporters
      The Armacost discussions with Deputy Foreign Minister
  Ryohei Murata and other senior Japanese officials will focus on
  USJapanese foreign aid programs and political security
  issues of mutual concern she added
      Although an exchange of views on bilateral relations is
  expected the talks are not directly related to USJapanese
  trade relations she insisted
      But in response to questions Oakley acknowledged that
  trade will be discussed
     Japans 586 billion dlrs trade surplus with the United
  States last year has come under fire in Congress which is
  concerned about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and
  with the record 169 billion dlrs US Trade deficit in 1986
