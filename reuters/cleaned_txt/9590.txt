SOUTHWESTERN BELL ltSBC SEES EARNINGS DILUTION
  Southwestern Bell Corp said that
  its planned acquisitions of cellular telephone and paging
  systems including those of ltMetromedia Inc will result in
  some initial earnings dilution and an increase in debt ratio
      In a letter to shareholders in its 1986 annual report the
  regional Bell company did not indicate the degree of earnings
  dilution it expects from the acquisitions which total some
  138 billion dlrs However the company said the rise in its
  debt ratio will be temporary and will leave its debt level
  within an acceptable range
      In its 1986 yearend financial statement Southwestern Bell
  listed a debttoequity ratio of 434 pct down slightly from
  437 pct in 1985
      In 1986 the company earned 102 billion dlrs or 1026
  dlrs a share compared with 9962 mln dlrs or 10 dlrs a share
  in 1985 Revenues dipped to 790 billion dlrs from 793 billion
  dlrs
      Southwestern Bell said it expects the new tax law to have a
  negative impact on its cash flow due mainly to the loss of
  investment tax credits
      By midyear however the company said a reduced corporate
  tax rate should have a positive impact on its net income and
  cash flow
      In addition the company said it is projecting a 17 pct
  gain in customer telephone lines and a three to four pct
  increase in long distance calling volumes
      Southwestern Bell said 1987 capital expenditures will be
  lower that the 197 billion dlrs spent in 1986 a year in which
  expenditures were held below budget
