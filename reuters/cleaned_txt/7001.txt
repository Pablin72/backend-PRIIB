FAIRFAX SAYS HIGHER TAX HITS FIRST HALF EARNINGS
  Media group John Fairfax Ltd ltFFXAS
  said that its flat first half net profit partly reflected the
  impact of changes in the Australian tax system
      Fairfax earlier reported net earnings edged up 23 pct to
  2594 mln dlrs in the 26 weeks ended December 28 from 2535 mln
  a year earlier although pretax profit rose 91 pct to 4830
  mln from 4429 mln
      Net would have risen 101 pct but for the increase in
  company tax to 49 pct from 46 and the imposition of the tax on
  fringe benefits paid by employers and not the recipients the
  company said in a statement
      Fairfax also pointed to the cyclical downturn in revenue
  growth in the television industry as another reason for the
  flat first half earnings
      It said it considered the result satisfactory in view of
  these factors
      Fairfax said its flagship dailies The Sydney Morning
  Herald and the Melbourne Age boosted advertising volume as
  did the Australian Financial Review and posted extremely
  satisfactory performances Magazines also performed strongly
      But an 89 pct rise in television costs outweighed a 40
  pct rise in revenue it said
      Fairfax said a fall in net interest also contributed to net
  earnings because group borrowings were reduced following the
  receipt of a 9611 mln dlr capital dividend from ltAustralian
  Associated Press Pty Ltd AAP after the sale of AAPs B
  shares in Reuters Holdings Plc ltRTRSL
      This accounted for the 8932 mln dlr extraordinary profit
      Fairfax said it is too early to predict results for the
  full year Increased borrowings after the recent 320 mln dlr
  acquisition of the HSVSeven television station in Melbourne
  will hit earnings but networking with the Channel Sevens in
  Sydney and Brisbane will produce some offsetting cost savings
