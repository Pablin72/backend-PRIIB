MANNESMANN BUYS INDIRECT MAJORITY STAKE IN SACHS
  Mannesmann AG ltMMWGF said it has
  reached a series of agreements giving it an indirect majority
  stake in the ltFichtel und Sachs AG car parts group
      The takeover is contingent on approval from the Federal
  Cartel Office in West Berlin a spokesman said adding that
  Mannesmann was confident the authorities would not block the
  purchase
      Mannesmann is buying 75 pct of ltMEC Sachs
  Vermoegensholding which owns 375 pct of Sachs AG which in
  turn holds 965 pct of Fichtel und Sachs The MEC shares will
  be bought from the granddaughters of the firms founder
      Mannesmann is also purchasing a 2501 pct stake in Fichtel
  und Sachs from Commerzbank AG ltCBKGF and has an option to buy
  the banks remaining 10 pct stake a company statement said
      In addition to these firm agreements Mannesmann is also
  talking with the stateowned steel group Salzgitter AG
   ltSALGH on buying its 2498 pct stake in Fichtel und Sachs
   This would give Mannesmann around 75 pct of Fichtel und Sachs
      Salzgitter said it decided to give up its own original
  plans to seek a majority stake in Sachs after holding talks
  with the government in Bonn
      Earlier this month Mannesmann disclosed that it might want
  a majority stake in Sachs after previously saying it was
  seeking to buy only a minority holding in the company which
  has annual turnover of 22 billion marks and employs 17000
      The acquisition is part of Mannesmanns efforts to
  diversify into hightechnology areas and away from its previous
  reliance on steel and pipemaking More
      A spokesman for the Federal Statistics Office later said
  the anticartel authorities would probably rule on the takeover
  in the new few weeks
