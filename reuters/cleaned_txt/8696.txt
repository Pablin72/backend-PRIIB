IRAN SAID TO TEST FIRE SILKWORM MISSILE IN HORMUZ
  Iran has testfired its newly acquired
  Silkworm antishipping missile in the Strait of Hormuz and has
  set up at least two landbased launching sites in the area a
  British naval source in the Gulf said
      The source who declined to be identified said Iran had
  fired the Chinesemade missile at a hulk off its southern Gulf
  naval port of Bandar Abbas and scored a hit
      These missiles pack a fairly big punch he told Reuters
  There is no doubt they could be used to target shipping
  across the Strait of Hormuz
