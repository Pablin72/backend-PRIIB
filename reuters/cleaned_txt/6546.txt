SURALCO BAUXITE REFINERY REOPENED
  The 14 mln tonnes capacity bauxite
  refinery at Paranam in Surinam which closed at the end of
  January after being sabotaged by antigovernment rebels has
  now reopened a spokesman for Dutch metals company Billiton
  said
      The refinery is run by Suralco jointly owned by the US
  Company Alcoa and the Dutch company Billiton which is a
  whollyowned subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell
      Production of alumina at the refinery is currently running
  at around 3000 tonnes a day and is expected to get back to
  full capacity of 4000 tonnes within a week the Billiton
  spokesman added
      The refinery was forced to close at the end of January when
  rebels cut the main power line
      Earlier the refinery had had to import some supplies of
  bauxite as rebel activity shut off supplies from Alcoas mine
  at Moengo in the east of the country
      Billitons mine at Onverdacht between Paranam and the
  capital Paramaribo is still working but Moengo remains closed
  and the refinery is continuing to import some bauxite the
  Billiton spokesman said
