TALKING POINTBORGWARNER CORP ltBOR
  BorgWarner Corp will vigorously
  resist GAF Corps 46dlrpershare takeover offer but the
  Midwest conglomerate may fall prey to another offer
  either from GAF or its own management analysts believe
      Analysts also said BorgWarner may attempt to escape GAF
  through a restructuring The speculation pushed BorgWarners
  stock up 138 to 4812 in heavy trading
      Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman will
  stage a tough campaign to gain control of BorgWarner so he can
  add its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF
      It seems from at least their dealing with raider Irwin
  Jacobs that they dont want to be taken over The question is
  now do they acquiesce to GAF I think instinctively they want
  to remain independent said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps
      BorgWarner has been under siege by takeover speculation
  for almost a year Last week Jacobs investment vehicle
  Minstar Inc and an investor group sold its 101 mln
  BorgWarner shares The same day GAF Corp raised its stake by
  91 mln shares to 199 pct of the outstanding
      Jacobs was interested in buying the company but took no
  steps toward a transaction
      Their BorgWarner policy has been to stonewall them for
  the last nine months Its been one of the dullest corporate
  battles Ive seen said one analyst
      The battle however has heated up and the range of
  breakup values on Wall Street span from the current market
  price to almost 60 dlrs per share Most analysts said they
  think a price in the low 50s would be appropriate
      Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily on
  its 316 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of BorgWarner
      Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end up
  with BorgWarner or enrich his chemicals and building materials
  company in some other way Heyman two years ago attempted an
  unsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp but GAF benefited
  from that companys restructuring
      Borg Warner cant quibble that its not a legitimate
  offer It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind of
  between a rock and a hard place They either have to accept a
  46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where its sweetened I
  personally think the company is worth around 55 dlrs per
  share said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson
      Henderson also speculated the company might attempt a
  restructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire and
  Rubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir James
  Goldsmith The company bought back the financiers stock and
  carried out a wider share repurchase
      Arbitragers however said they do not believe Heyman is
  seeking greenmail or the repurchase of his stock by the
  company at a premium
      Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems with
  financing the transaction
      Previously associated with junk bond experts Drexel
  Burnham Lambert Inc GAf said it would finance its BorgWarner
  takeover with bank financing GAF said it would make a tender
  offer following a merger agreement approved by the BorgWArner
  board and conditioned on the boards recommendation of the
  tender offer and merger
      Heyman said in a letter to BorgWarner that he expects a
  merger would provide job security for BorgWarner employees
  since the two companies businesses overlap Analysts however
  believe Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repay
  debt from the transaction
      GAFs stock rose 158 today to 4858
     I believe obviously if GAF takes over BorgWarner at the
  level it is proposing it would enhance GAF share values
  substantially said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose
      He said at 46 dlrs per share Heymans average cost for the
  companys stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAFs
  current holdings
      Rose said the BorgWarner plastics and chemical business
  which makes thermoplastics is the asset attracting Heyman
  Analysts said it accounts for a third of Borgs earnings
      The plastics are used in telephone equipment office
  equipment and appliances Borg has half the market in the US
  and is the leading technical player and the leading innovator
  Rose said Its competitors are Dow Chemical Co ltDOW and
  Monsanto Corp ltMTC he said
      BorgWarner also has an automotive parts business and a
  protective systems business which includes Wells Fargo
  security guards It also has an information services business
  and is trying to sell its financial services business
      BorgWarner earned 2061 mln dlrs or 235 dlrs per share on
  revenues of 362 billion dlrs in 1986 Smaller GAF in 1986
  earned on an operating basis 807 mln dlrs or 222 dlrs per
  share on sales of 7538 mln dlrs
      GAFs net earnings included an after tax gain of 2014 mln
  from its participation in a Union Carbide exchange offer a
  special union carbide dividend and the sale of its Union
  Carbide shares
