NO BUNDESBANK POLICY CHANGES EXPECTED THURSDAY
  The Bundesbank is unlikely to change
  its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on
  Thursday as exchange rates and shortterm interest rates have
  stabilized over the past few weeks money market dealers said
      Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrows
  tender for a securities repurchase pact from which funds will
  be credited on Thursday when an earlier pact expires draining
  16 billion marks from the system
      The tender was announced last Friday because carnival
  festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday and will
  close banks here this afternoon
      Because of the disruption to business from carnival
  minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are
  unrealistic making it difficult for banks to assess their
  needs at the tender
      Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough
  liquidity in this weeks pact to keep shortterm rates down
      But because of uncertainty about banks current holdings
  the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks
  this week and top it up if necessary at next weeks tender
      I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount
  a little to say 14 or 15 billion marks one dealer said
      They would then stock it up at the next tender when the
  need is clearer he added
      An earlier pact expires next week draining 85 billion
  marks from the system Banks also face a heavy but temporary
  drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers
      Banks held 520 billion marks on February 27 at the
  Bundesbank averaging 510 billion over the whole month just
  clear of the 505 billion February reserve requirement
