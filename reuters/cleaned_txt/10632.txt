BANK SEES MODEST RECOVERY IN GULF ARAB ECONOMIES
  The Emirates Industrial Bank has
  predicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states
  following higher oil revenues
      A bank study carried by the Emirates news agency WAM said
  total oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council GCC
  countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from
  335 billion in 1986
      The GCC groups Bahrain Kuwait Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia
  and the United Arab Emirates UAE
      The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil
  prices made possible by last Decembers OPEC accord to restrain
  overall group production
      These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight
  dollars a barrel in mid1986 to around 18 dlrs
      All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in
  the economies of these GCC countries although this expected
  growth will not be similar to that of the 1970s boom years
  the study said
      It added however that GCC states would experience higher
  budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past
  recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts
      The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise
  to 232 billion dlrs from 179 billion last year
      It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states combined
  trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 215 billion in
  1985
      The UAE suffered a 195 pct drop in gross domestic product
  to 776 billion dirhams last year from 964 billion in 1985 it
  added
