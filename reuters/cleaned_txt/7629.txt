  and preproduction stripping at its Sunbeam Mine in Custer
  County Idaho as quickly as possible
      The company said the study found proven ore reserves of
  3302000 short tons grading 0077 ounce of gold per ton  It
  said the mine will operate at a rate of 626000 tons of ore per
  year with highergrade ore being mined in the first three
  years for a rapid payback of capital costs
      The company said the feasibility study calls for gold
  production averaging 41000 ounces a year for the life of the
  mine and 50000 ounces a year over the first three years with
  99000 ounces of silver per year being produced over the miune
  life

  included in reserve calculations It said eight of the nine
  holes drilled there have an average grade of 0046 ounce of
  gold and 21 ounces of silver per ton Also excluded are
  reserves of 1400000 tons of lowgrade material that could be
  milled profitably at 425 dlrs a ton for gold The feasibility
  study used a 350 dlr gold price

  dlr per ounce of gold for the mine life and 171 dlrs for the
