CSR SELLING DELHI TO EXXON UNIT DROPS DELHI FLOAT
  CSR Ltd ltCSRAS and Exxon Corp ltXON
  unit ltEsso Exploration and Production Australia Inc said CSR
  has agreed to sell its ltDelhi Australia Fund DAF to Esso for
  985 mln Australian dlrs
      The sale is effective from tomorrow they said in a joint
  statement
      The previously announced float of part of its Delhi
  interest will not now proceed CSR said in the statement
      Delhi Australia Fund owns ltDelhi Petroleum Pty Ltd which
  holds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd ltSTOSSled
  Cooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects
      In addition to the purchase price CSR will share equally
  in any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensate
  prices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhis
  interests in the next two years the statement said
      The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will
  be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the
  float CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement
      Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus
  efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building
  materials in which CSR has had long and successful management
  experience and strong market leadership
      With the sale CSR will be able to expand those businesses
  more aggressively and earlier he said
      As reported separately soon after announcing the Delhi
  sale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 6826 pct of ltPioneer
  Sugar Mills Ltd that it does not already hold valuing its
  entire issued capital at 2196 mln dlrs
      After Bass Strait the onshore Cooper and Eromanga Basin is
  Australias largest oil and gas producing area with current
  gross oil production of 45000 barrels per day BDP gas
  liquids output of 30000 BPD and gas sales of 480 mln cubic
  feet a day the CSREsso statement said
      The purchase gives Esso a 5050 partner with The Broken
  Hill Pty Co Ltd ltBRKNS in the Bass Strait its first onshore
  production in Australia they said
      Essos chairman Stuart McGill said he hoped Esso can assist
  in maintaining the high rate of oil and gas discoveries in the
  CooperEromanga area
      These discoveries will help Australias selfsufficiency in
  oil reserves thereby offsetting in part the decline in Bass
  Strait production now under way McGill said
      In a separately released letter to CSR shareholders Kelman
  said CSR was within days of completing plans for the float of
  CSR Petroleum when it received an offer from Esso
      He said CSR is convinced the sale was the correct decision
  in view of the risks associated with the oil business
      The pricesharing arrangement provides for CSR to share
  equally with Esso in higher returns if oil prices average more
  than 20 US Dlrs a barrel in the next two years he said
      Kelman said a revaluation of CSRs investment in Delhi to
  net realisable value as of today CSRs annual balancedate
  will result in an extraordinary loss of 97 mln dlrs
      However revaluations and profits on sales of other assets
  will significantly reduce this loss he said
      He also said that CSR is sufficiently encouraged by future
  prospects and the opportunity to reposition the group in core
  businesses to foreshadow an increase in final dividend payable
  in July to 10 cents from nine to make an annual 19 cents
  against 18 in 198586
