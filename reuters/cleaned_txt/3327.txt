CAROLIN MINES ltCRLNF HAS NEW ASSAY RESULTS
  Carolin Mines Ltd
  said recent assays of tailings at its Hope British Columbia
  mine indicated that ounces of gold per ton ranged from 064 to
  050
      There were only trace amounts of platinum and palladium
  the company said
      Carolin said the results sharply disagreed with an earlier
  assay performed by Intergold USA Inc which showed one ounce
  of gold per ton and 12 ounce of platinum per ton
      Carolin also said it expects to receive results of further
  tests and assays of the tailings within two to three weeks
