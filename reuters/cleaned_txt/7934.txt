ANALYST SAYS USSR WINTER GRAINS HURT BY WEATHER
  The Soviet Unions winter grain
  crop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting
  conditions last fall and severe cold this winter an analyst of
  world weather and crop conditions said
      Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell author of the
  EF Hutton publication Global Crop News said in her latest
  report that the Soviets may import more grain possibly wheat
  from the US due to potential crop damage
      Compared with last year the outlook for the Soviet
  winter grain crop is far more pessimistic she said But
  its still too early to talk about disastrous losses A lot
  will depend on spring weather not only for the outcome of the
  troubled winter grain crop but also for spring planting
      Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably
  prevented optimal seed germination for winter grains Key wheat
  growing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasus
  received on 2535 pct of autumn precipitation she said
      The bitter winter cold temperatures  which broke record
  lows that had stood for four decades  also may have taken its
  toll on Soviet winter crops she said
      However she noted that most of the southern grain belt had
  ample snow cover which should have wellinsulated the majority
  of crop areas from severe frost damage
      The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains
  in the July 1986June 1987 marketing year primarily from
  Canada the European Community Argentina and Australia
  Martell said
      She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop
  problems that might point to additional Soviet import demand
      Last falls dry weather may limit livestock grazing on
  moisturedepleted pastures while the cold winter weather
  necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy
      Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986
  grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes and said the Chernobyl
  accident may have contaminated more grain than originally
  thought and have to be made up with imports
      However she said the US remains a supplier of last
  resort for the Soviet Union noting that the Soviets have only
  just recently begun their first US grain purchases of the
  198687 season by buying 225 mln tonnes of corn
      Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980
  grain embargo the US is only a major supplier of grain to the
  USSR during years of heavy Soviet demand
      In 198485 the US supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain
  imports of 555 mln tonnes But in 198586 the Soviet Union
  bought 299 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the US for only
  24 pct of that total
      While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 198687
  was 22 mln tonnes many US grain analysts have revised their
  estimates of Soviet imports up to 2528 mln tonnes she said
