UNION TO PROTEST DARTS SUPERMARKETS ltSGL BID
  The United Food And Commercial
  Workers said that more than 1000 rankandfile members of the
  union will demonstrate Monday at Dart Group Corps headquarters
  protesting Darts proposed 173 billion dlr takover of
  Supermarkets General ltSGL
      Supermarkets is best known for its Pathmark chain of
  supermarket drug stores in the New York and New Jersey area and
  also owns Rickels home centers
      The union said that it is firmly against the Dart bid
  because workers have always ended up with a raw deal in the
  current takeover mania
      A Union statement said We do not intend to allow our
  members to pick up the tab for Supermarket Generals executives
  and the bankers or the Dart Group who stand to make millions
      Dart is controlled by the Haft family of Washington which
  last year made a bid for Californiabased Safeway Stores Inc
  The Hafts lost but walked away with at least 100 mln dlrs in
  profits analysts estimate
      The union said that Darts Safeway bid forced a major
  restructuring at Safeway to pay the Hafts and their lawyers and
  caused a loss of thousands of jobs
