PALM OIL OUTPUT SEEN DROPPING SHARPLY  OIL WORLD
  Malaysian and Indonesian palm oil
  production is likely to drop sharply this year due to lower
  yields the Hamburgbased newsletter Oil World said
      The publication expects total Malaysian output during
  JanSept 1987 to decline by eight pct to 305 mln tonnes For
  East Malaysia it put production during the period at 297000
  tonnes after 312000 a year earlier and for West Malaysia 275
  mln compared with just over 30 mln during JanSept 1986
      It said new plantings had slowed markedly in both
  countries but the effects of this will not be felt until
  198890
      Above normal yields during recent years resulted in trees
  reacting to the stress by changing the sex ratio to more male
  inflorescences andor aborting more female Oil World said
      Yields per hectare are also likely to be adversely affected
  this year by insufficient rain up to 25 months ago This could
  especially affect trees in West Malaysia during AprilJune
  while in East Malaysia the impact will be in FebruaryApril and
  JulyDec and in Indonesia JulySept
      Last years cut in fertilizer use will hit this years
  yields and bigger effects are expected within the next three
  years Oil World said without elaborating
      Opening stocks in West Malaysia at the start of this year
  were put at only 565000 tonnes compared with 914000 in
  January 1986 Oil World said
      West Malaysian net exports are therefore expected to drop
  500000 tonnes to 254 mln during JanSept while those of East
  Malaysia are likely to decline by 10 pct to 280000 tonnes
      Indonesian palm oil production is forecast to fall about
  eight pct during JanMay but to rise from June on Overall
  Indonesian output during JanSept is forecast to rise three pct
  to 933000 tonnes Indonesian stocks as of April 1 however
  are put at only 65000 tonnes compared with 160000 a year ago
      Indonesian export commitments and domestic requirements are
  both running at high levels Oil World said and it expects the
  countrys imports to reach a record 110000 tonnes during
  JanSept The bulk of this will arrive during FebMay ahead of
  the April elections and the religious Ramadan festival
  throughout May it said
      Indonesian net exports therefore may fall by 29 pct to
  350000 tonnes Oil World said The possibility that recent
  Indonesian palm oil purchases will not actually enter the
  country but be transshipped to other countries to fulfill
  Indonesias export orders cannot be ruled out it said
