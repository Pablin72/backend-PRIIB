US JOBS DATA SAID TO RULE OUT FED TIGHTENING
  A steep drop in goodsproducing jobs
  detracted from US March nonfarm payroll employment and makes
  it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary
  policy to defend the dollar economists said
      US March nonfarm payroll employment rose 164000 less
  than the gain of 220000 to 290000 the financial markets
  expected Manufacturing employment fell 25000 compared with
  Februarys 50000 gain while March construction employment
  dropped 45000 after being unchanged in February
      The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we
  end the first quarter said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley
  and Co Inc This sets the stage for more sluggish growth in
  the second and third quarters
      The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy
  he said They will not ease as long the dollar is weak but
  clearly they cant tighten
      David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downward
  revision in February nonfarm payroll employment to 236000
  from 337000 means that employment gains in the first quarter
  were weaker than expected
      While Wyss left his firstquarter forecast of real US
  gross national product growth at 35 pct he said the March
  jobs data suggested a downward revision in his secondquarter
  growth forecast to 25 pct from 28 pct
      Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the average
  monthly gain in nonfarm jobs in the first quarter was only
  237000 compared with 254000 in the fourth quarter of 1986
      Theres momentum in first quarter labor force activity 
  but less than assumed he said Gains in goodsproducing jobs
  were subdued at best This rules out any possibilty of the Fed
  tightening for exchangerelated purposes
      In March the average workweek fell back to its January
  level of 348 hours from 350 hours in February Manufacturing
  hours also fell back to their January level totalling 409
  hours in March compared with 412 hours in February
      The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturing
  jobs in March was concentrated in automobile electrical and 
  electronic manufacturing
      Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a
  13000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for
  nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs
      Economists said that a buildup in auto inventories
  resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with
  the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead
      Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five
  pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in
  the firstquarter GNP accounts
      Roach said he expects first quarter US GNP to rise two
  pct to be followed by a gain of 1015 pct at best in the
  second and third quarters He said the March drop in industrial
  activity is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate
  contribution inventory accumulation made to GNP
      Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains
  in industrial production and personal income for March
  They expect only marginal gains if not small declines for
  these indicators compared with a February increases of 05 pct
  in industrial production and 09 pct in personal income
      Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop
  in March construction employment may also signal a drop in
  March housing starts which rose 26 pct in February to 1851
  million units at an annual rate from 1804 million units in
  January
      The rate of unemployment fell to 66 pct its lowest level
  since March 1980 from 67 pct in February But Wyss pointed
  out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force which 
  fell to 1192 mln in March from 11935 mln in February
      This just means that there were fewer people looking for
  work so the drop in unemployment doesnt mean much he said
      He said the latest employment report will not concern the
  Fed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of
  2530 pct but it does suggest they cant afford to tighten
  to quickly either
      The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal
  fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor
  force gains just as seasonal factors probably overstated them
  in January and February Slifer said but are consistent with
  his forecast of 18 pct first quarter GNP growth
      Economic growth remains sluggish but Silfer does not think
  that the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their
  meeting this week At some point they will be more inclined to
  ease he said For the time being however the March
  employment report increases the likelihood they wont tighten
  regardless of the dollar
