CONTROL RESOURCE ltCRIX SEES LOWER EARNINGS
  Control Resource
  Industries Inc said the company estimates 1986 earnings to be
  between 800000 and 900000 dlrs or 22 to 25 cts per share
  compared with 852000 dlrs or 33 cts per share during 1985
      The company said preliminary estimates of 1986 revenues is
  245 mln dlrs compared with 7900000 for 1985
      The estimated 1986 results are based on 3207000 shares
  outstanding compared to 2566000 shares outstanding for 1985
      R Steven Lutterbach chairman said net income for 1986
  was adversely affected primarily due to lower operating margins
  at the companys Western Environmental subsidiary and to an
  increase in bad debt reserves
      Western Environmental was acquired in March 1986
  Lutterbach explained the company has taken steps to improve
  financial and accounting controls primarily at Western which
  were not adequate at the time of acquisition
      He noted the final results for the fourth quarter will
  depend on the allocation of increased costs between the second
  and fourth quarters
      Lutterbach said it is possible second quarter results will
  be restated though final net income for the year will remain
  in the estimated range
      He added preliminary indications for first quarter 1987
  revenues were favorable
