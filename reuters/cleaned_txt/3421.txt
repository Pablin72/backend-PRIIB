US INTERVENED TO AID DLR IN JANUARY FED SAYS
  US authorities intervened in the
  foreign exchange market to support the dollar on one occasion
  during the period between the start of November 1986 and the
  end of January the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a
  report
      The Feds quarterly review of foreign exchange operations
  said that the US bought 50 mln dlrs through the sale of yen
  on January 28 This operation was coordinated with the Japanese
  monetary authorities and was funded equally by the Fed and the
  US Treasury
      The Feds intervention was on the morning after president
  Reagans State of the Union message and was in a manner
  consistent with the joint statement made by US Treasury
  secretary James Baker and Japanese finance minister Kiichi
  Miyazawa after their January 21 consultations
      At that meeting the two reaffirmed their willingness to
  cooperate on exchange rate issues
      The Feds report did not say at what level the intervention
  occurred But on January 28 the dollar closed at 1515060 yen
  after dipping as low as 15040 yen earlier in the session It
  had closed at 1510515 yen the previous day
      The dollar had plumbed a postWorld War II low of 14998
  yen on January 19 and reached a sevenyear low of 17675 marks
  on January 28 It ended that day at 1782030 marks
      The Fed noted that after trading steadily throughout
  November and the first half of December the dollar moved
  sharply lower until the end of January
      It closed the threemonth review period down more than 11
  pct against the mark and most other Continental currencies and
  seven pct lower against the yen and sterling It had fallen
  four pct against the Canadian dollar
      During the final days of January pressure on the dollar
  subsided Reports of the USJapanese intervention operation
  and talk of an upcoming meeting of the major industrial
  countries encouraged expectations for broader cooperation on
  exchange rate and economic policy matters the Fed said
      Moreover doubts had developed about the course of US
  interest rates The dollars swift fall had raised questions
  about whether the Fed would let shortterm rates ease
      Thus the dollar firmed to close the period at 18320 marks
  and 15370 yen According to the Feds tradeweighted index it
  had declined nine pct since the beginning of the period
      The dollar had risen as high as 208 marks and 165 yen in
  early November
      The Fed last intervened in the foreign exchange market on
  November 7 1985 when it bought a total of 1022 mln dlrs worth
  of marks and yen
      The Feds action followed the September 1985 Plaza
  agreement between the five major industrial nations under which
  they agreed to promote an orderly decline of the dollar
