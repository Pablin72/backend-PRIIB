SOVIETS SAID TO SEE NEW FLOOR FOR GRAIN OUTPUT
  The intensive technology concept for
  grain production has put a new floor under USSR grain
  production the US Agriculture Departments officer in Moscow
  said in a field report
      The report quoting a broadcast on Radio Moscow said that
  due to intensive technology grain production in a bad year will
  not fall below 200 mln tonnes and in a good year grain
  production could reach 250 mln tonnes
      The US Agriculture Department currently forecasts this
  years USSR crop at 2101 mln tonnes and if realized this
  would be the third year since 1975 that the Soviet Unions
  grain harvest has exceeded 2000 mln tonnes
      The largest crop since 1975 was 2374 mln tonnes harvested
  in 1978 according to USDA data
