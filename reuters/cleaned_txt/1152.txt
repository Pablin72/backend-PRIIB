ROYAL BANKCANADA SEES HIGHER 1987 LOAN LOSSES
  ltRoyal Bank of Canada said it
  estimates 1987 loan losses at one billion dlrs a 25 mln dlr
  increase over last year
      Royal Bank said it set its provisions given the continued
  debtservicing problems  in the North American energy
  industry and the uncertain outlook for energy prices and also
  continued to add to its general provisions for loans to
  troubled borrower countries
      The banks loan loss provision for the first quarter ended
  January 31 rose to 223 mln dlrs from 187 mln dlrs in the
  yearago quarter
      The bank said nonaccrual loans net of provisions for loan
  losses totalled 22 billion dlrs on January 31 up from 20
  billion dlrs a year ago
      In reporting lower first quarter earnings chairman Allan
  Taylor said problems with credit qualityparticularly in loans
  associated with the energy sectorcontinue to have a
  substantial adverse effect on the banks earnings
      Taylor said profitability of the banks international
  operations remains weak reflecting resourcerelated
  difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and
  unsatisfactory results from capital market activities
      Taylor said it would be premature to speculate on the
  outcome of debt resturcturing negotiations with Brazil or their
  potential impact on the Royal Bank
      The bank earlier reported first quarter profit fell to
  1141 mln dlrs from 1404 mln dlrs a year ago
