JAPAN HAS LITTLE NEW TO OFFER IN MICROCHIP DISPUTE
  The Japanese government appears to have
  little new to offer to settle a dispute with the US Over
  computer chips trade analysts and government officials said
      The US Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300
  mln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the US In
  retaliation for Japans alleged failure to keep a pact on the
  microchip trade signed last September
      A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters Japan has done
  what it can and now we must persuade the United States to wait
  for those steps to take effect
      The US Alleges that in defiance of the September
  agreement Japan is still selling microchips at below cost in
  nonUS Markets and refusing to open Japan further to US
  Chip sales US Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17
       Analysts noted Japans Ministry of International Trade and
  Industry MITI has already ordered chipmakers to cut
  production in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in
  third countries at nonregulated prices
      Im not sure MITI can do much more than it has said
  Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd analyst Nick Edwards
      A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to call
  for production cuts beyond those already sought although it
  would continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods
      Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said they
  would consider buying more US Chips But a Matsushita
  Electric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase in
  imports was not likely
      Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit if
  the United States did implement the tariffs which would be
  levied on consumer electronics products rather than on
  microchips themselves
      If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time
  there will be complete erosion of exports to the United States
  said Tom Murtha analyst at James Capel and Co
      The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be
  stopped altogether but recovery for the industry will be
  delayed for another year he said
      Some analysts said tariffs would also harm US Industry by
  stepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japan
  for semiconductors US Firms are trying to sell here
      The American approach is full of contradictions Jardine
  Flemings Edwards said
      If they want to expand US exports the last thing they
  want to do is hit the makers of the final products because that
  hurts the final market Edwards said
      But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just US
  Concern over what it sees as a strategic industry but also
  frustration with Japans vast trade surplus Some analysts
  argued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may have
  to take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact
      Carole Ryavec an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd
  said The major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic
  economy and move away from an exportdependent economy
