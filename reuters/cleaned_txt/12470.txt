BANK OF JAPAN INTERVENES JUST AFTER TOKYO OPENING
  The Bank of Japan intervened just after
  the Tokyo market opened buying dollars at around 14765 yen
  dealers said
      They were unsure of the amount of the central banks
  purchasing but it seemed to prevent the dollar from weakening
  against the yen amid bearish sentiment for the US Currency
  they said
      The dollar opened at 14765 yen against 1472030 in New
  York and 14690 at the close here yesterday
