INDONESIA LIMITS OIL PRICE IMPACTFINANCE MINISTER
  Indonesia has minimised the economic
  impact of falling oil prices kept inflation within limits and
  boosted exports Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said
      Indonesia was badly hit by last years steep plunge in
  crude prices which cut revenue from oil exports by half
      But Prawiro was quoted by Indonesian newspapers as telling
  President Suharto that inflation was kept to around nine pct in
  the financial year ending tomorrow against around 43 pct the
  previous year
      Exports were estimated to have risen by seven pct he said
  although he did not give complete figures
      The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to general
  elections next month in Indonesia a major producer of rubber
  palm oil tin timber and coffee
      Prawiro said 198687 had also been difficult because of the
  appreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark against
  the dollar which increased Indonesias debt repayments
      He said the economy would have suffered more from the world
  economic recession if the government had not devalued the
  rupiah by 31 pct last September
      In an editorial on the economic outlook the Jakarta Post
  said the government must press ahead with measures to
  deregulate the economy to help boost nonoil exports
      The Englishlanguage daily said bigger export earnings were
  needed to finance not only imports but also the countrys
  growing foreign debt estimated at around 37 billion dlrs
      About 50 pct of our foreign debt obligations fall due
  within the next three to five years and will steadily increase
  the debt servicing burden the paper said
      However endinvestors were seen bargain hunting in
  expectation of a further yen interest rate decline dealers
  said
      Most dealers were cautious in the face of the dollars
  nosedive today and the possibility of a US Interest rate
  rebound to halt further dollar depreciation
      A 47 pct coupon and volume of 1400 billion yen for the
  April 10year bond proposed by the Finance Ministry this
  afternoon were taken favourably by the market
