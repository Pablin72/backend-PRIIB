TOKYO BIDS TO STOP CHIP ROW BECOMING TRADE WAR
  Japan is seeking to prevent its computer
  chips dispute with the US From erupting into a fullscale
  trade war government officials said
      We hope that the dispute on this specific issue wont have
  an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United
  States a Ministry of International Trade and Industry MITI
  official said
       On Friday Washington announced plans for as much as 300
  mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyos
  alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact
      That agreement reached last year after heated
  negotiations called on Japan to stop selling cutprice chips
  in world markets and to buy more Americanmade semiconductors
      Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the
  fallout from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime
  Minister Yasuhiro Nakasones planned trip to Washington at the
  end of April
      While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure
  the chip pact is working the government is studying measures
  it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure
  the trips success they said
      The perception of Japan in the US Congress is very bad
  one official told Reuters We would very much like to do
  something to respond to that
      In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from
  spreading to other areas MITI officials sought to depict the
  US Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor
  makers not to the government
      Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an
  angry American Congress the Japanese government has been
  forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor
  dispute trade analysts said
      They said that it was an open secret that Japans largest
  chip maker NEC Corp was not happy with what it viewed as the
  draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact
  included enforced production cuts
      The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the
  announcement of the US Tariffs highlighted the difficulties
  the government faces in taking further action
      Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the
  USJapan agreement said Shoichi Saba Chairman of the
  Electronic Industries Association of Japan
      He accused the US of being irrational He said the US
  action had made the bilateral chip pact meaningless
      Sabas comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister
  Yasuhiro Nakasone who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute
  through consultations
      Japan is expected to send a highlevel official to
  Washington early next month to try to convince the US Not to
  go ahead with the tariffs on April 17
      Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industry
  plans to step up purchases of US chips and to propose a joint
  investigation into US allegations of chip dumping
