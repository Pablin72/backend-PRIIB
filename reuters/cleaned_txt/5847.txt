ZIMBABWE MAIZE OUTPUT TO FALL 65 PCT
  Maize deliveries to Zimbabwes
  stateowned Grain Marketing Board GMB will fall by over 65
  pct this year following a prolonged dry spell agricultural
  industry sources said
      They said 1987 maize deliveries are expected to decline to
  around 520000 tonnes from 16 mln tonnes last year About 60
  pct of the maize will be delivered by largescale commercial
  farmers and the balance by smallscale peasant producers
      Although this will be the lowest level of maize deliveries
  since 1980 the sources said there is no danger of a food
  shortage in Zimbabwe
      While annual maize consumption is estimated at 750000
  tonnes the GMB stockpile is currently around 18 mln tonnes
  which means that even with the sharply reduced production this
  year Zimbabwe has enough maize for the next three years
      The sources said the lower maize crop would be offset by a
  25 pct increase in cotton production to 315000 tonnes from
  248000 tonnes last year and by a rise of 20 pct in soybean
  deliveries to 100000 tonnes from 84000 tonnes in 1986
