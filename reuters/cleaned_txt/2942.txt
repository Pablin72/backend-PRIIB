US TREASURY PROPOSES SAFRICAN URANIUM IMPORTS
  The US Treasury proposed allowing 
  temporary imports of South African uranium ore and uranium
  oxide until July 1 under certain conditions pending
  clarification of antiapartheid laws passed by Congress last
  fall
      The Treasury said it proposed allowing the temporary
  imports because it felt Congress had not intended when it
  passed the comprehensive South African sanctions bill last fall
   overriding President Reagans veto  to hurt US industry
      The Treasury said an outright US ban of uranium ore and
  oxide might cause foreign electric utilities to divert their
  South African origin ore and oxide to other countries including
  the Soviet Union for processing
      The Treasury also proposed allowing USorigin goods to be
  imported temporarily from South African statecontrolled
  organizations for repair or servicing in the US
      The South African sanctions law enacted by the US to
  protest the apartheid laws of racial segregation practiced by
  South Africas white minority government prohibited imports of
  uranium ore and oxide iron and steel coal and textiles at the
  end of 1986
