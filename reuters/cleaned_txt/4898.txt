CUBA SUGAR CROP SEEN AT LEAST SAME AS LAST YEAR
  Cuban sugar export figures for January
  suggest that this years crop may be at least as large as last
  years 735 mln tonnes according to sugar analysts
      Exports in January totalled 733000 tonnes raw value up
  from 725000 a year earlier according to figures received by
  the International Sugar Organization
      January is the first major export month and the figures
  thus give a good indication of the current crop they said
  Fourth quarter exports fell to 622000 tonnes from 909000
  tonnes a year earlier but this was because Cuba was destocking
  at the end of 1985 they added
      Trade house C Czarnikow recently estimated production this
  year at 750 mln tonnes
      Cuban sugar production in the third quarter of 1986 was
  12000 tonnes giving a final 198586 crop total of 735 mln
  tonnes compared with a 198485 crop of 810 mln tonnes
      There is normally no third quarter production in Cuba but
  a hurricane meant that last years crop was extended
      Exports to the USSR were substantially down in January at
  362000 tonnes from 489000 in January 1986 but other Comecon
  countries received 210000 tonnes against 80000 tonnes in the
  same month last year figures received by the ISO show
      Bulgaria Czechoslovakia Poland and Romania all took
  substantially more Cuban sugar
      Cubas November 1986 exports totalled 158000 tonnes
  compared with 190000 tonnes in 1985 and Decembers total was
  237000 tonnes down from 518000 tonnes the year before
  Calendar year exports for 1986 were also lower at 669 mln
  tonnes against 721 mln in 1985  the lowest level since
  1980s 619 mln tonnes the figures show
