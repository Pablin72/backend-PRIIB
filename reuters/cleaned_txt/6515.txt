STUDY SHOWS ONLY LIMITED OPTIMISM FOR SILVER
  Silver looks unlikely to break out of
  gold and platinums shadow in the near future although this
  year is likely to see demand increasing at a faster rate than
  supply a study by Credit Suisse said
      The study predicted demand rising by 300 tonnes to 13200
  tonnes this year against a 50 tonne increase in supply to
  14050 tonnes This should cut the global oversupply to 850
  tonnes from last years provisional 1100 tonnes
      The study noted that the effects of last years lower
  prices were having a dampening effect on total supply which
  was now back down to around levels of a decade ago
      However the study said that primary production likely to
  reach 10000 tonnes this year against a provisional 9950 in
  1986 is relatively insensitive to price falls
      Around a third of silver production comes from heavily
  indebted Mexico and Peru
      Pricesensitivity is also reduced by the fact that the
  majority of silver is a byproduct of other mining activity
