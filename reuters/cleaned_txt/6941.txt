US CARGO PREFERENCE FUNDING ACCORD SEEN NEAR
  The US Departments of Agriculture
  and Transportation are close to agreement on how to fund the
  increasing share of food aid to be shipped on US flag vessels
  under a 1985 farm bill provision on cargo preference
      Melvin Sims USDAs general sales manager told a House
  Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that the two
  departments are negotiating a memorandum of understanding on
  cargo preference
      Under a 1985 farm bill provision the percentage of food
  aid shipments carried on US flag vessels was to gradually
  increase over three years to 75 pct in 1988 The increased cost
  of using US vessels was to be funded by the Transportation
  Department instead of USDA However USDA officials said
  Transportation has so far contributed no money
      The agreement between USDA and Transportation is expected
  to resolve the matter USDA officials said
      Tom Kay administrator of the USDAs Foreign Agricultural
  Service said yesterday the requirement that more food aid
  shipments be carried on US vessels has been difficult to
  meet
      As the tonnage required under cargo preference goes up
  its going to be harder and harder to meet Kay said
      Two farm state Congressmen Pat Roberts RKan and Glenn
  English DOkla said cargo preference makes US farm export
  programs more costly and the program should be eliminated
      In the past farm interests opposed to cargo preference
  have been defeated in Congress by the maritime interests who
  view cargo preference as vital to the US shipping fleet
