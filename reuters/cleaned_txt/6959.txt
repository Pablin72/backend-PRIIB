AUSTRALIAN EXPORTS HELPING TO BOOST GDP
  The strong contribution of exports to
  the growth in Australias gross domestic product GDP in the
  fourth quarter of 1986 was a significant and welcome feature of
  the data private economists polled by Reuters said
      Real GDP rose 11 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 after
  rising 02 pct in the third quarter and falling 11 pct a year
  earlier
      Equally significant was the decline in both private and
  government spending they said
      Exports of goods and services rose 13 pct in the fourth
  quarter while imports rose only 29 pct Statistics Bureau
  figures show Consumer spending declined 06 pct and government
  spending by 02
      Bob Edgar of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group
  Ltd said the governments aim of reducing the current account
  deficit by boosting exports and lowering consumption to cut
  imports appeared to be working
      However he cautioned that care must be taken to keep
  growth restrained because if it accelerated too fast imports
  would increase and worsen the balance of payments
      Andre Morony of Bankers Trust Australia Ltd added the
  result was positive because growth was exportdriven
      But he said the GDP rise came as no surprise given the
  growth in exports disclosed in other statistics
      The economists comments were echoed by Treasurer Paul
  Keating in a statement issued in Canberra
      Keating said the figures showed encouraging trends for a
  reduction in the current account deficit notably the decline
  in domestic demand and the strong increase in exports
      A further 35 pct fall in the terms of trade in the quarter
  underscored the need to continue restraint in wages prices and
  public sector spending and borrowing to improve Australias
  competitiveness he said
      It is clear that through the continued application of that
  strategy Australia will make the necessary adjustments in its
  external accounts and return to a more sustainable growth
  pattern he added
