JAPAN TO CUT MICROCHIP OUTPUT BOOST IMPORTS
  Leading domestic semiconductor makers
  will boost imports and cut production of key memory microchips
  from next month in line with government attempts to ward off
  US Trade sanctions company spokesmen said
      The moves might persuade the US To call off the
  sanctions despite obstacles to full implementation of the
  plans analysts said
      The tariffs will affect about 300 mln dlrs worth of
  products and are in retaliation for Japans alleged failure to
  honour a semiconductor trade pact
      In announcing the sanctions last Friday President Reagan
  said Japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatory
  pricing and open Japans market to foreign products
      But US Trade representative Clayton Yeutter said
  yesterday on US Television that the US Is willing to drop
  the tariffs if Japan shows a clear indication that it will open
  its markets to US Goods
      The Ministry of International Trade and Industry MITI has
  urged producers to slash output of the chips by 11 pct in the
  second quarter following a call to reduce production by more
  than 20 pct the previous quarter
      MITI also urged makers to boost chip imports
      Analysts said the moves could encourage Washington to
  cancel the tariffs ahead of next months meeting between Prime
  Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan
      The US Wants to be satisfied It has rattled its sword
  and shown that it can and will do business said analyst Nick
  Edwards at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd in Tokyo
      But analysts cautioned that although Japanese producers can
  cut output boosting imports  the key to US Withdrawal of
  the sanctions  is more difficult
      The US Does not have the lowend consumer ICs
  integrated circuits that the Japanese need for consumer
  products Theyre well supplied here said Richard May senior
  analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd in Tokyo
      The US Leads in production of medium and highend ICs
  but Japanese makers are keen to develop their own highend
  production skills the analysts said
      The Japanese must be prepared to trade some losses on
  semiconductors in return for free access to other areas said
  Edwards
      A spokesman for Hitachi Ltd ltHITT said the firms
  reduced output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory
  256K DRAM was unrelated to MITIs efforts to ward off the
  trade sanctions Decreased production was a natural result of
  the company increasing output of onemln bit DRAMs he said
      Company officials unveiled the following plans 
       NEC Corp ltNESIT Japans largest chipmaker plans to
  slash production of 256K DRAM semiconductors by 2941 pct to
  six mln per month from a monthly average of 85 mln last
  quarter
       In the year beginning April 1 NEC will boost chip
  imports which comprised some 20 pct of all NEC chip
  consumption the year before
       Hitachi Ltds ltHITT April output of 256K DRAMs will
  fall by 2593 pct to four mln compared to 54 mln in March The
  company is trying to boost imports but has not set a specific
  target Imports are currently very low
       Toshiba Corp ltTSBAT will reduce April 256K DRAM
  production by 1667 pct to just over four mln and is
  considering ways to boost imports a company official said
      Toshiba has an agreement with Motorola Inc MOTN to sell
  the US Firms chips in Japan The firms are planning a
  jointventure production of memory chips in Sendai northern
  Japan
       Mitsubishi Electric Corp MIETT will trim second
  quarter output by about 10 pct to between 55 mln to 56 mln
  chips compared to the first quarter Plans call for increased
  imports but an official said boosting imports will be difficult
  as it depends on sales demand
       Fujitsu Ltd ITSUT will cut production in accord with
  MITI guidelines and boost imports from currently low levels
       Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd OKIET will reduce April
  production by 10 pct from Marchs 32 mln Oki is studying ways
  to increase imports by 10 pct in the fiscal year beginning
  April 1 from the previous years total of more than five
  billion yen a company official said
