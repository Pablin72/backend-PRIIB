TOSHIBA REGRETS LINK WITH UK ACCESS ISSUE
  Toshiba Corp ltTSBAT said it regrets its
  plan to enter the UK Business facsimile and telephone market
  may be caught up in a diplomatic row over the position of Cable
  and Wireless Plcs ltCAWLL in the Japanese market
      Britain is considering how to retaliate against Japans
  attempt to prevent Cable and Wireless from taking a major
  position in a Japanese international telecommunications
  venture
      As a matter of timing it is regrettable that this has been
  linked with the question of market access in Japan a Toshiba
  spokesman told Reuters
      ltToshiba Information Systems UK Ltd a Toshiba
  subsidiary said yesterday it planned to enter the UK Market
  under the Toshiba own brand name and had applied for government
  approval to do so
      Toshiba has supplied equipment to UK Manufacturers for
  sale under their brand names since last year
      The Toshiba spokesman said the sale of such equipment was
  not comparable to Cable and Wireless efforts to take a stake
  in the new Japanese telecommunications firm
      They are matters of a different category he said
