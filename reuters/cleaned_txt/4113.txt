GERMAN PUBLIC AUTHORITY BUNDESBANK HOLDINGS FALL
  The net position of federal states
  worsened in the first March week cutting public authority net
  holdings at the Bundesbank by 500 mln marks the central bank
  said
      States cash deposits at the central bank fell to 800 mln
  and they also drew down 12 billion marks in book credit 900
  mln marks more than in the prior week
      By contrast however the federal government was able to
  reduce its credit drawdown at the central bank by 900 mln marks
  to 900 mln
      Despite the stronger states net needs in the week their
  cash position and other market dependent influences just about
  balanced the outflow of liquidity from the money market through
  an increase in cash in circulation the Bundesbank said
      Cash in circulation rose by 14 billion marks in the week
  to 1229 billion
      Liquidity also came in through the maturing of shortterm
  treasury bills bought from the Bundesbank in the prior week
      Gross currency reserves rose in the week by 400 mln marks
  to 1099 billion Foreign liabilities of the Bundesbank were
  largely unchanged at 228 billion marks giving a rise in net
  currency reserves of 400 mln to 870 billion it said
      The Bundesbank said its balance sheet total fell by 377
  billion in the week to 21845 billion
