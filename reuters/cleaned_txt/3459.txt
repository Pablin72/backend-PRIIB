  ltKFHGF is considering taking a stake in shipping and
  transport group HapagLloyd AG ltHPLGF but has yet to reach a
  final decision a spokesman said in response to queries
      Press reports said Kaufhof wanted a stake of up to 125 pct
  in HapagLloyd
      The Kaufhof spokesman noted any decision on purchasing
  shares in the shipping group would have to be approved by the
  supervisory board which is due to hold a meeting tomorrow
      Late last year the Gevaert group of Belgium and West
  Germanys VEBA AG ltVEBGF said they had each acquired a 125
  pct stake in HapagLloyd from Deutsche Bank AG ltDBKGF and
  Dresdner Bank AG ltDRSDF
       Industry sources estimate Deutsche and Dresdner
  HapagLloyds majority shareholders held about 75 pct of
  HapagLloyds share capital before selling portions of it to
  Gevaert and VEBA
      The two banks have said they eventually wanted to reduce
  their stake in the shipping group to 15 pct each
