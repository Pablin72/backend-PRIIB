BELGIAN GOVERNMENT TO CUT FINANCIAL REQUIREMENT
  Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried
  Martens announced to Parliament a plan to reduce the 1987
  government financing requirement by 206 billion francs
      He said this will enable the requirement to be held to
  4197 billion francs against the previous government target of
  4178 billion or eight pct of gross national product
      Martens said following a lowering of government estimates
  of 1987 nominal GNP growth and a reestimation by government
  departments of 1987 spending the government calculated that
  unless action was taken the requirement would exceed the
  target by 225 billion francs
      Martens said the plan involved raising nonfiscal receipts
  by 58 billion francs and reducing spending by 143 billion
  The remaining 05 billion francs will be raised through
  treasury operations
      Martens said the money is being found through a series of
  small economies and confirmed that it includes the raising of
  two billion francs through the sale of part of the governments
  50 pct holding in the gas company Distrigaz
      Last year the government announced a major program
  designed to cut 1987 spending by 195 billion francs
      The program was designed to get Belgium out of what the
  government said was a snowball effect under which the
  government constantly borrowed more to finance budget deficits
  which were due largely to the cost of servicing and repaying
  existing debt
      In 1986 the government financing requirement is estimated
  at 561 billion francs or 110 pct of GNP
