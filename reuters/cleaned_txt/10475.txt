DEALERS SAY FED INTERVENED BUYING DOLLARS IN US
  US dealers said the New York Federal
  Reserve Bank has intervened in the foreign exchange market
  today buying dollars against yen
      Fed officials do not comment on such intervention but
  dealers said it appeared that the Fed had intervened when the
  dollar reached 14750 yen in New York
      The dollar subsequently hovered at 1475565 yen
      Dealers said they were uncertain about the size of the
  intervention but some said it was only for a small amount
  They were also uncertain whether the Fed intervened on its own
  account or if it executed orders for the Bank of Japan
