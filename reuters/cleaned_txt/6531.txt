UK BASE RATES WILL FALL AGAIN SOON SAY ANALYSTS
  Todays modest halfpoint cut in UK
  Bank base lending rates to 10 pct signals the Bank of Englands
  determination to maintain a cautious monetary stance but
  financial markets appear set to force its hand analysts said
      They said a further halfpoint cut in base rates to 912
  pct was bound to occur within the next week and rates may shed
  a further half point soon if markets remain buoyant
      Earlier markets were bracing for a onepoint cut in rates
  after yesterdays budget set a sharp three billion stg
  reduction in 1987 government borrowing targets to four billion
  stg
      Sterling money market rates moved lower again with the key
  threemonth interbank rate down to 958 12 pct at the start
  of business from 91116 916 yesterday and sterling rallied
  to fouryear highs against the dollar in very active trading
      Government bond prices also surged on the budget with
  gains in excess of one point pushing yields on longterm paper
  below nine pct for the first time in nearly a year
      But todays smaller than expected rate cut appeared to have
  placated markets for now analysts said Money market rates
  recovered up to 14 point from earlier lows while both sterling
  and gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt
      Analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary and
  the reappraisal of sterling assets by international investors
  was set to resume as early as tomorrow leading to higher gilt
  prices exchange rate advances and lower money market rates
      Todays cut was slightly disappointing said Bill Martin
  chief UK Economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew The
  Bank of England is taking a very cautious line  To temper
  the markets first rush of blood to the head after the budget
      Analysts said the banks move today to lend twoweek cash
  to UK Discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped to
  maintain the new rates for about that period of time
      The analysts agreed success would depend largely on how
  sterling performs in the near term
      Sharp rises in the pounds value could be checked initially
  through Bank of England intervention but eventually the gains
  would force the bank to cut interest rates rates again
      The market seems to have accepted the modest cut for the
  time being said Midland Bank treasury economist David
  Simmonds But I am sceptical that the bank will be able to hold
  up rates for long
      Simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two US Cents
  this week from around 160 dlrs forcing a rate cut by Friday
      Robin Marshall chief economist at Chase Manhattan
  Securities said There is another half point to come in the
  near term this week or next week at the latestWe see a
  whole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks
      Analysts stressed that apart from prestige Britain had
  very little to gain from a sharp rise in sterlings exchange
  rate
      Martin of Phillips and Drew said the dampening effect of
  a sterling rise on consumer price inflation would not
  materialise for at least nine months while its hampering impact
  on manufactured exports would show almost immediately
      Analysts said the budget featuring income tax cuts as well
  as cautious plans for public finances had improved the chances
  of reelection for the Conservative government and probably
  advanced the election date One must be held before June 1988
  Combined with overall good prospects for the UK Economy this
  was likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterlingdenominated
  assets pushing the pounds value well above unofficial
  targets
      With markdenominated investments largely out of favour
  because of low yields and a dull economic outlook Chases
  Marshall said Sterling is simply the best game in town
  especially after the budget and demand will remain strong
