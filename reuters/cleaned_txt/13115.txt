CANADA OIL INDUSTRY SET FOR RECOVERY  ANALYSTS
  Firmer crude oil prices government aid
  packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canadas oil
  industry recover from last year sharp downturn industry
  analysts said
      They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987
  compared to last years dismal results when oil prices dropped
  about 50 pct
      On Canadas stock exchanges energy shares have soared to
  their highest levels since 1983 with many issues trading at
  record highs
      This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the
  part of the investment community that the outlook for the
  industry for the future is extremely attractive Peters and Co
  Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said
      Financial statements from Canadas major oil companies
  culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltds 220 billion Canadian dlr
  1986 loss reported this week painted a bleak picture of last
  years results analysts said
      But the financial statements are a snap shot and a
  recording of history The stock market is the indication of the
  future Gobert commented
      The Toronto Stock Exchanges oil and gas index of 41
  companies is up to 40654 so far in trading today from 305315
  at the end of 1986
      Among Canadas largest oil companies class A shares of
  Imperial Oil Ltd ltIMOA 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp ltXON is
  trading at 71 up from a 52week low of 3434
      Shell Canada Ltd 72 pct owned by Royal DutchShell Group
  is at 4012 up from a low during the last year of 1834
  Texaco Canada Inc ltTXC 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc ltTX is
  at 3478 up from a low of 2412
      Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts
  operating profit for 10 of Canadas largest oil and gas
  companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 144 billion dlrs
  and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 324 billion
  dlrs based on an average oil price for the year of 1650 US
  dlrs a barrel However if prices hold about 18 US dlrs a
  barrel1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase
  with cash flow 27 pct higher analyst Plexman said
      Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the
  profit improvement this year the gain should be significant
  he added
      Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986 when
  operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 105
  billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 290
  billion dlrs
      But one industry source doesnt think oil prices will hold
  recent gains and more government assistance is needed
      Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans
  Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987
  after dipping about 60 pct last year Maciej said he sees crude
  oil supply outweighing demand and doesnt believe a recent OPEC
  production accord will continue to support prices
      However several companies share the optimistic industry
  outlook expressed by a majority of analysts
      Shell Canada and ltNorcen Energy Resources Ltd forecast
  improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this
  week assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels
      The industrys outlook for 1987 is positive but not
  robust Texaco Canada said in its annual report
      While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is
  good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable
  continued volatility is likely Texaco Canada added
      In the face of shortterm uncertainty many companies have
  pared 1987 spending plans from last years lower levels
  deferring most frontier exploration work
      The industry is becoming very selective in investments
  very conservative and cautious which is not unexpected
  Canadian Petroleum Associations Maciej said
      Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion
  the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results
      The most significant help came last September when the
  federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax
  PGRT 28 months earlier then planned
      Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil
  companies about 150 billion dlrs by the end of 1988
      The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow
  decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further
  exploration spending cuts analysts said
      For a number of companies the PGRT cut was absolutely
  necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that
  were made otherwise the reduction would have been considerably
