CREDITANSTALT SEES HIGHER 1987 DIVIDEND
  CreditanstaltBankverein ltCABVVI is
  likely to raise its 1987 dividend from the 1986 payment of 12
  pct of share capital deputy generaldirector Guido
  SchmidtChiari said
      The 1985 dividend was 10 pct unchanged from the previous
  year and SchmidtChiari noted that the parent banks share
  capital had risen to 31 billion schillings at the end of 1986
  from 27 billion a year earlier
      SchmidtChiari made the forecast at a news conference when
  the bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profit
  of 4967 mln schillings for 1986 against 3545 mln in 1985
      SchmidtChiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast
      The banking groups consolidated balance sheet total rose
  to 4534 billion schillings at yearend from 4254 billion
      General director Hannes Androsch said higher investment
  would lead to continuing growth in profits in future Last
  years better profits had resulted from improvements in
  services provided by the bank and also in profits on schilling
  lending
      Schilling lending had grown last year and interest rate
  margins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory when
  compared with those in other countries he said
      Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home and
  abroad particularly in Latin America had lowered profits
  Androsch said but declined to give an exact figure
      SchmidtChiari said that foreign lending business had
  fallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations
  removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheet
  total
      In an attempt to generate more foreign business

  abolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares and
  drawing dividends

  1986 than in previous years giving a return on investment of
  26 pct compared with 13 pct in 1985 Creditanstalt Austrias
  largest bank holds majority interests in 10 mediumsized and
