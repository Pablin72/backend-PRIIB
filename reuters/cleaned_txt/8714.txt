DOLLAR DROP SEEN AS TEST OF PARIS AGREEMENT
  The sharp drop in the value of the
  dollar against the yen and the mark is the first serious test
  of last months Group of Five G5 plus Canada agreement to
  stabilise currencies dealers and bank economists said
      The dollar will be pushed down until there is coordinated
  central bank intervention one dealer for a German bank said
  echoing widepread sentiment in the market
      But opinion was divided on whether the united front forged
  in Paris still exists Some dealers said there were growing
  signs the United States wanted the dollar to fall further
      Despite repeated Bank of Japan intervention the dollar
  plunged to a postwar low in Tokyo today It was quoted as low
  as 14840 yen in the Far East and dealers here said they
  expected the US Currency to decline further
      The dollar is now firmly within a broad 140 to 150 yen
  range Chase Bank AGs senior dealer Eckhart Hager said
      Others said there were technical reasons for the sharp
  dollar drop Windowdressing operations by some Japanese
  companies who were selling dollars and buying yen before the
  end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 were undermining
  the US Currency
      Dealers said main reason for the selloff was not
  technical US Treasury Secretary James Bakers comment the
  Paris accord did not have fixed dollar targets was seen as a
  renewed attempt by the US Administration to talk the dollar
  down
      Suddenly support levels which had existed for fear of
  central bank intervention disappeared one dealer said
      The Bank of Japan was believed to have bought some 15
  billion dlrs and this with comments by Japanese officials
  indicated Tokyo was unhappy about the plunge dealers said
  Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita threatened central bank
  intervention if necessary
      Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today the
  time had come for the six nations who agreed in Paris last
  month to stabilise currencies  Japan Britain Canada France
  the US And West Germany  to take action in line with the
  pact
      But the Bundesbank and other European central banks were
  not detected in the open market during the European morning
  Opinion here was divided on when the Bundesbank would act
      While some said the West German central bank would support
  the dollar once it fell below 180 marks others said the
  Bundesbank would only intervene after a fall below 175 marks
  or if the decline accelerated
      The Bundesbank last intervened on January 27 when the
  dollar threatened to fall below 181 marks
      The Japanese seem to be on their own at the moment one
  dealer said Others said cooperation between central banks and
  governments was easier said than done
      Some said Bakers remarks and US Trade Representative
  Clayton Yeutters warning that the US And Japan were on the
  verge of a serious trade conflict showed there was a rift
      Its hard to tell whether the G6 agreement still stands a
  dealer said Another added If the Americans do not get what
  they want they will push the dollar down regardless of G6
      Citibank AG also cast doubt on the chances of success for
  the Paris agreement in its latest investment letter
      It is hard to see that Japan and Germany are willing or
  able to loosen fiscal policy sufficiently to offset the
  necessary US Fiscal contraction Citibank said
      It added Markets should therefore be aware that 180 marks
  is not the lower limit for the dollar  a rate of 170 marks
  or even less is expected this year
      And London Broker Hoare Govett said in its March 1987
  economic report We are looking for a further more gradual
  fall possibly to 160 marks by the end of the year
      But opinion about whether the Paris accord was still in
  force was not universal Some dealers said not too much should
  be read into Bakers and Yeutters comments
      There is no reason to believe the Paris pact has broken
  down a senior dealer said
