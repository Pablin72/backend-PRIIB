TREASURY FOREIGN RESERVES ARE JORDANS PRIORITIES
  Jordans key economic priorities are
  having a sound national treasury and adequate foreign exchange
  reserves Prime Minister Zeid alRifai said
      First the national treasury should be in sound shape when
  dealing with the public and other countries so that its
  credibility is preserved he said in a television interview
  Saturday
      The second priority is to maintain an acceptable level of
  foreign exchange reserves to provide the stability and
  confidence needed by the government to meet foreign
  commitments
      Rifai said Jordans outstanding governmentguaranteed and
  commercial loans total 902 mln dinars with a debt service ratio
  of 149 pct
      The figure was sharply lower than the 102 billion dinars
  in outstanding loans at the end of September according to
  latest Central Bank figures
      Rifai dismissed the view of some bankers and economists
  here that the dinar which is pegged to a basket of currencies
  is overvalued
      The dinar is strong and stable and we intend to preserve
  its stability he said
      The prime minister said he hoped the next Arab summit would
  tackle the question of continuing financial aid to Jordan
  Under a 10year agreement reached in 1978 Jordan was to
  receive a total of 125 billion dlrs annually from Algeria
  Iraq Kuwait Libya Qatar Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
  Emirates to help it resist Israel
      But only Saudi Arabia met its obligations while the others
  failed because of falling income due to lower oil prices
