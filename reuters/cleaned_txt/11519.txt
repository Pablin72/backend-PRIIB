USDAS AMSTUTZ SYMPATHETIC TO WOOD CREDITS
  US Agriculture Undersecretary
  Daniel Amstutz said he was totally sympathetic with US wood
  producers desire to have their exports eligible for government
  credit guarantees
      But he told the Senate Appropriations Agriculture
  subcommittee that including wood products in the departments
  short or intermediateterm export guarantee programs would
  conflict with US multilateral trade obligations
      Currently US wood products are not eligible for
  government export credit guarantee because they are considered
  manufactured products Amstutz said
      He said USDA had devoted an enormous amount of time to
  considering making wood products eligible for the guarantees
  and that Congress was considering a measure to do so
