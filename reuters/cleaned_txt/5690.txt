SCHLUMBERGER ltSLB MAY HAVE ALTERNATE BUYER
  Schlumberger Ltd most likely has an
  alternate buyer lined up for its Fairchild Semiconductor unit
  Wall Street analysts said
      I think its clear that in cancelling its agreement with
  Fujitsu Schlumberger has signaled that it has another deal in
  the works said Paul Johnson a semiconductor analyst with
  LF Rothschild
      There are unquestionably other buyers out there added
  Kidder Peabody analyst Adam F Cuhney A lot of companies have
  looked at Fairchild and would be willing to buy it
      Among the companies that would be interested in bidding for
  Fairchild are Advanced Micro Devices ltAMD Sunnyvale Calif
  and LSI Logic Corp ltLLSI Milpitas Calif industry analysts
  said
      Top US chipmakers like National Semiconductor Corp ltNSM
  Texas Instruments Inc ltTXN and Motorola Inc ltMOT might also
  seek to buy Fairchild but could possibly run into antitrust
  problems the analysts added
      Moreover Fairchilds management is thought to be
  considering proposing a leveraged buyout of the Cupertino
  Calif company analysts said
      In a brief statement announcing the termination of the
  agreement with Fujitsu Schlumberger said the decision opened
  up other possibilities including a possible buyout by
  Fairchild management
      The company said it ended the deal in which Fujitsu would
  have bought 80 pct of Fairchild for an estimated 200 mln dlrs
  because rising opposition to the deal by the Reagan
  administration made it unlikely that the sale could be
  completed within a reasonable period of time
      Analysts questioned this explanation however arguing that
  the companies did not need government approval to complete the
  transaction Both Schlumberger and Fujitsu are foreignedowned
  companies
      Schlumberger would not have terminated the deal because
  the US government didnt want it said Johnson of LF
  Rothschild
      A spokesman for Schlumberger declined to elaborate on the
  companys news release
      He said only that the company was reviewing a number of
  possible alternatives for the Fairchild unit
      Officials at Fairchild and Fujitsu were not immediately
  available for comment
      Analysts noted the significance of the governments
  apparent success in preventing Fujitsu from taking control of
  Fairchild
      Administration officials including Commerce Secretary
  Malcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
  feared that the sale to Fujitsu would lead to Japanese control
  of key semiconductor technology for supercomputers and military
  weapons systems
      The government really stood up for the semiconductor
  industry said Johnson of LF Rothschild That I think is
  the real significance of this
      Consequently analysts said the Japanese government might
  now feel more pressure to address US complaints about
  Japanese chipmakers violation of the semiconductor trade
  agreement signed last summer
