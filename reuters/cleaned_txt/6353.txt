  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd ltCAPHHK
  forecast another good year in 1987 in view of good growth in
  both passenger and cargo traffic volumes early this year over
  the yearearlier period
      The airline did not quantify its performance in early 1987
  but said it would take delivery of one Boeing Co ltBAN 747
  freighter and one Boeing 747300 passenger plane in September
  and November respectively after it took a 747300 last month

  cents a share
      But Cathay Pacific recorded sharp increases in net finance

  funds placed with investment managers had partly offset higher
  interest costs resulting from additional lease financing and
  other borrowing

  1985
