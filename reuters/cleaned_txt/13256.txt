IEA SEES ONE PCT GROWTH IN 1987 OECD OIL DEMAND
  Growth in oil consumption in the Western
  industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct
  this year compared with 23 pct in 1986 the International
  Energy Agency IEA said
      Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around
  one pct in first quarter 1987 to 359 mln bpd the IEA said in
  its Monthly Oil Market Report
      Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from
  transport fuels as in 1986 But if average consumer prices are
  higher than 1986 the rate of growth for these fuels may be
  below last years 36 pct it said
      The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices
  stay close to current levels some destocking by endusers can
  be expected If that happens natural gas will also regain some
  of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986 and there
  may be slightly less growth in transport fuels
      IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at
  428 mln tonnes representing 98 days of forward consumption
  This is about the same level as at the begining of the year
      The agency said this flat trend is explained by the
  projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of
  the year which offset a reduction in stocks
      It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell
  by 12 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the
  year This followed a small rise in January of 04 mln bpd but
  a decline of 15 mln bpd in February and 25 mln bpd in March
      It is possible that final data will show a larger draw
  particulary for March it said As crude production also fell
  there is likely to have also been a decline in nonreported
  stocks particularly at sea the IEA said
      Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes
  on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986 Governments built
  up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the
  period
      The yearonyear trend of government stock building is
  continuing with yearonyear company stocks also rising more
  or less in line with consumption after declining for five
  years the IEA noted
      Oil stocks on land in the US And Canada were put at 2066
  mln tonnes on April 1 down from the 214 mln tonnes on January
  1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption
  respectively
      Oil stocks in Western Europe were 1474 mln tonnes on April
  1 down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to
  94 days of consumption
      World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln
  bpd to 452 mln bpd from 472 mln bpd in last quarter 1986
      This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude
  production to around 155 mln bpd in FebruaryMarch from 165
  mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from
  centrallyplanned Economies the IEA said
      Total OPEC crude oil supply was 158 mln bpd in the first
  quarter plus 14 mln bpd of NGLs compared with 173 mln bpd
  of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 179 mln average
  for the whole of 1986 Supply from nonOPEC countries totalled
  28 mln bpd against 285 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986
      A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast
  33 mln bpd in March from 36 mln bpd in February was the
  largest factor behind the OPEC production decline the IEA
  said
      Saudi Arabias Opecassigned output quota is 4133 mln bpd
