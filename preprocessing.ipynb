      "EUROPEAN COFFEE TRADE PROPOSES NEW QUOTA FORMULA\n",
      "  European coffee roasters and traders\n",
      "  have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating\n",
      "  International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch Coffee\n",
      "  Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said.\n",
      "      Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee\n",
      "  Federation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting.\n",
      "      The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and\n",
      "  would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an\n",
      "  unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current\n",
      "  coffee agreement, van Horick said.\n",
      "      If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the\n",
      "  ICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new\n",
      "  agreement, van Horick said.\n",
      "      Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when\n",
      "  prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in\n",
      "  Brazil.\n",
      "      Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and\n",
      "  producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.\n",
      "      \"Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the\n",
      "  formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal\n",
      "  leaves it very little to object to,\" van Horick said.\n",
      "      \"The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not\n",
      "  reflect supply and demand reality,\" he said. \"Our formula\n",
      "  builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost\n",
      "  everyone.\"\n",
      "      Although full implications of the new formula have still to\n",
      "  be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as\n",
      "  Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly\n",
      "  higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El\n",
      "  Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.\n",
      "      Because the proposal provides that future quota\n",
      "  distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it\n",
      "  should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing\n",
      "  so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota.\n",
      "      \"If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least\n",
      "  a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the\n",
      "  September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a\n",
      "  new quota formula, \" van Horick said.\n",
      "      At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude.\n",
      "      \"Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If\n",
      "  there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two\n",
      "  months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might\n",
      "  just get an agreement,\" van Horick added.\n",
